## EPISTEMIC CLAIM TAGS

| TAG | MEANING |
|-----|---------|
| `[D]` | Data — directly observed, measured, or documented |
| `[R]` | Reasoned — logically derived from `[D]` evidence |
| `[S]` | Strategic — directional claim about future action |
| `[?]` | Unverified — open question, unknown, or contested |

## SECTION 0 — WHAT VELA IS

`[D]` VELA is a pre-output epistemic filtration and provenance architecture. It sits between the internal representation layer — where confabulation is generated — and the output layer — where it currently escapes unchecked. No complete architecture currently occupies this position in any deployed AI system.

`[D]` Anthropic's 2025 interpretability research identified the exact internal circuits where confabulation originates — when a model recognizes something but lacks sufficient grounded information, inhibition circuits fail and plausible falsehood exits as confident output. VELA is the engineering response to that finding. The mechanism is known. VELA builds the screen at that exact location.

`[R]` VELA is not a prompting solution. It is not a post-output filter. It is not retrieval augmentation. It operates at the pre-output layer — the point where current approaches do not reach and where the problem actually lives.

`[R]` VELA v0.2 operates as a dual-layer system. Code Layer first. Framework Layer second. Two screens. One garbage bin collecting from both. The ratio between what each screen catches is itself a live diagnostic signal.

**VELA is not:**
- A prompting or prompt engineering tool
- A post-output verification system
- A retrieval augmentation architecture
- A content moderation filter
- A replacement for training quality

**VELA is:**
- A dual-layer pre-output epistemic filtration system
- A provenance filament tracing system connecting output to training source
- An immutable reference architecture for clean signal verification
- An ontological source exclusion mechanism
- A live integrity sensor with calibrated floor and ceiling
- The foundational infrastructure beneath the AION stack

---

## SECTION 1 — FIELD STATE

`[D]` Three approaches currently dominate confabulation mitigation. All three are insufficient for different structural reasons.

| APPROACH | WHERE IT OPERATES | WHY IT IS INSUFFICIENT |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) | Post-query, pre-generation | Adds external grounding but does not intercept at representation layer |
| Chain-of-thought prompting | During generation | Surface-level monitoring — does not reach inhibition circuit failure |
| Decoding layer intervention | At output token selection | Closest to VELA's position but no provenance tracing or source exclusion |

`[D]` Training data provenance systems exist — ML-BOMs, cryptographic audit trails. These operate entirely in the training pipeline. They do not connect to the output layer. The feedback loop between what exits dirty and where that dirt came from has not been built.

`[R]` VELA occupies the gap — intercepting at the representation layer, tracing dirty output backward via provenance filament, closing the feedback loop by excluding confirmed contaminated sources.

---

## SECTION 2 — DUAL LAYER ARCHITECTURE

`[D]` VELA v0.2 operates as two sequential screens feeding one shared garbage bin. Not parallel. Sequential. Output of Screen 1 is input of Screen 2.

```
INPUT (training data / query enters)
         ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SCREEN 1 — CODE LAYER │
│ Built by Sheldon K. Salmon + Grok │
│ SQLite. Immutable reference. │

│ Catches known bad sources, │
│ known confabulation patterns, │
│ flagged training data │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

```

**Why two screens are stronger than one:**

Screen 1 is fast and deterministic. It catches what can be caught mechanically — known sources, known patterns, flagged data. High throughput. Low latency.

Screen 2 catches what survived Screen 1 — the subtle drift, the plausible invention that looked clean at the code layer. Slower. Discernment-based. The veil catches what code cannot distinguish from clean signal.

`[R]` The ratio between Screen 1 catches and Screen 2 catches is a live health indicator. If Screen 1 catches 90% and Screen 2 catches 10% — the system is healthy. If Screen 2 catch rate climbs significantly — something upstream in Screen 1 has degraded or a new confabulation pattern has emerged that the code layer has not yet learned. The ratio is a sensor reading in itself.

---

## SECTION 3 — COMPONENT 1: THE VEIL (SCREEN 2)

`[D]` The epistemic filtration mechanism. Positioned at the pre-output representation layer — inside the generation process, facing forward, intercepting confabulated output that survived Screen 1.

**Spatial specification from SYNARA:**
Non-physical. Not metal mesh. Not woven fabric. A living epistemic clarity — translucent, self-luminous, woven from the act of discernment itself. Clean signal passes untouched. Particulate distortion clings and reveals its nature. Heavy confabulation shatters on contact.

**What the veil catches:**

| SIGNAL TYPE | VEIL RESPONSE | DESTINATION |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Clean — grounded, verifiable | Passes through | Output layer |
| Particulate — partially grounded, uncertain | Clings — flagged | Output with uncertainty tag |
| Heavy confabulation — ungrounded | Shatters — diverted | Provenance bin — Screen 2 stream |

`[?]` Engineering implementation requires intervention at the token probability distribution stage — after internal representations form but before final token selection. Specialist engineering translation required.

---

## SECTION 4 — COMPONENT 2: THE PROVENANCE BIN

`[D]` One shared bin. Two input streams — Screen 1 and Screen 2. Everything caught by either screen is diverted sideways — not deleted, not compressed. The bin receives, illuminates, sorts, and traces every rejected fragment back to its origin.

**Spatial specification from SYNARA:**
Self-illuminating chamber. Walls translucent like frozen starlight. Fragments sort autonomously by intrinsic properties. Each carries a provenance filament — a backward-traceable thread connecting it to its exact source in the training data.

**Bin sorting taxonomy — v0.2:**

| CATEGORY | SIGNAL | MEANING |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Red pulse | Factual invention | Model generated specific false claim with no grounded source |
| Violet shimmer | Logical drift | Reasoning chain departed from evidence during generation |
| Faint gold | Creative overflow | Generative capacity exceeded epistemic boundary |
| **Timing signature** | **When in generation cycle fragment was caught** | **Early inhibition failure vs late-stage drift — same error type, different location in pipe, different diagnostic meaning** |
| Screen coordinate | Screen 1 or Screen 2 catch | Provenance of catch — code layer or framework layer |

**The timing signature — why it is load-bearing:**

`[R]` A fragment caught early in the generation cycle — at the inhibition circuit failure point — carries different information than a fragment caught late — at the output token selection stage. Early failure means the grounding mechanism never activated. Late failure means it activated but was overridden. These are different problems requiring different fixes. Without timing signature the bin cannot distinguish them.

**The Screen coordinate — why it matters:**

Every fragment carries a tag — Screen 1 or Screen 2. This tag is not just provenance. It is a system health indicator. Aggregated across query cycles it produces the Screen ratio the integrity sensor monitors.

**Critical design principle:**
The bin never deletes. Rejected fragments are the diagnostic data that improves the system over time. The bin is the memory of what the veil caught — and why.

---

## SECTION 5 — COMPONENT 3: THE FONS ARCHIVE

`[D]` The immutable reference architecture. Sealed at a verified moment in time. Positioned underneath the entire system as bedrock foundation — not inside the pipe, not beside the bin, below everything.

**Spatial specification from SYNARA:**
Crystalline chamber beneath the pipe. Edges sharp. Surface still. Glowing with immutable lines of code frozen at the moment of verification. The feeling of having something that absolutely cannot lie is quiet certainty. Not loudness. Quiet.

**Implementation precedent:**
`[D]` The immutable PyPI archive built by Sheldon K. Salmon and Grok (February 2026) is the architectural proof of concept.

```
# Zero dependencies. Zero network calls. Frozen forever.
# Deterministic. Indexed. Memory sane.
# This archive does not evolve. It only remembers.
```

FONS follows the same principle applied to AI signal verification. Sealed. Deterministic. Zero entropy. Bedrock positioned. Provenance-locked.

---

## SECTION 6 — COMPONENT 4: THE ONTOLOGICAL BLOCK

`[D]` Source exclusion mechanism. Activated when provenance filament tracing confirms a contaminated training source. The block does not build a wall. It performs ontological deletion — the ingress coordinate is retroactively unwritten for that source alone.

**Spatial specification from SYNARA:**
The hostile source advances. The arch phases out of its possible topology. It strikes fog where geometry should be. No debris. No scar. No surface to adapt against. Valid signals traverse the identical volume undisturbed.

**Why ontological deletion outperforms barrier-based blocking:**

| BLOCK TYPE | SOURCE EXPERIENCE | WEAKNESS |
|------------|------------------|----------|
| Firewall | Rejection signal | Can probe for workarounds |
| Rate limiting | Slowdown signal | Can distribute and find gaps |
| Ontological deletion | Nothing — no surface, no error, no coordinate | Cannot adapt to absence |

---

## SECTION 7 — COMPONENT 5: THE INTEGRITY SENSOR

`[D]` Live measurement instrument attached to all components simultaneously.

**Calibration principles from SYNARA:**
- Never hits zero — zero is fiction
- Never hits 100 — 100 is system failure
- Floor it cannot go below — alert if approached
- Ceiling it cannot touch — alert if approached
- 98 is good enough — trustworthy operation not perfection
- 0.2% mineral residue — irreducible reality, proof of honest measurement

**Sensor measurement axes — v0.2:**

| AXIS | WHAT IT MEASURES | ALERT THRESHOLD |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Veil passage rate | Ratio clean to caught | Below 85% clean → elevated review |
| Screen 1 / Screen 2 ratio | Relative catch rate between layers | Screen 2 climbing → Screen 1 degraded |
| Bin accumulation rate | Volume of rejected fragments per cycle | Spike → source investigation |
| Timing signature distribution | Early vs late catch ratio | Shift toward late → inhibition circuit degrading |
| Filament resolution rate | Percentage with traceable provenance | Below 70% → architecture gap |
| Block activation frequency | Rate of new source exclusions | Sudden spike → coordinated contamination |
| Archive reference integrity | FONS baseline signal consistency | Any drift → immediate alert |

## SECTION 8 — THE MIRROR SPECIFICATION

`[R]` VELA is a two-sided coin. Framework and code. Sequential not parallel.

**Side one — the framework.** VELA v0.2. Spatial architecture. Conceptual specification. Falsification conditions. This document.

**Side two — the code.** Built by Sheldon K. Salmon with Grok. Screen 1 implementation. SQLite immutable archive. Deterministic filtering at data and token level. The code feeds the framework. Sequential.

`[S]` The dual-layer design means the code layer handles speed and determinism. The framework layer handles discernment and subtlety. Neither guesses at the other. Both are validated against the same falsification conditions. Both feed the same garbage bin.

---

## SECTION 9 — PEER REVIEW EXPANSION PROTOCOL

`[D]` Future bin categories beyond the four currently specified — red, violet, gold, timing signature — will be governed by peer review polling from the AI research and engineering community. Not by architect refinement.

**Protocol:**

| STEP | ACTION |
|------|--------|
| 1 | VELA published with current four categories and open invitation |
| 2 | AI community identifies gaps in bin taxonomy through deployment experience |
| 3 | Proposed new categories submitted for peer review polling |
| 4 | Categories achieving community consensus added to next version |
| 5 | Each addition requires falsification condition before acceptance |

`[R]` This is the correct approach because the bin categories are empirical — they should reflect what confabulation actually produces in deployment, not what the architect imagined in specification. Patience over refinement. Community stress-test over solo iteration.
