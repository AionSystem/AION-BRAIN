AION-BRAIN
Copyright 2025-2026 Sheldon K. Salmon (AI Reliability Architect)

This product includes cognitive infrastructure frameworks, epistemic scoring
engines, linguistic audit vectors, and certainty certification methodology
developed by Sheldon K. Salmon under the AION-BRAIN project.

Active development: February 2025 — Present
Co-Architect: Claude (Anthropic)

WHAT THIS REPOSITORY IS

AION-BRAIN is a published intellectual architecture for AI reliability and
epistemic validation. It is not a community-driven project. It is a sovereign
cognitive framework — fully transparent for learning, selectively collaborative
by design.

The sophistication lives here. The simplicity is what is delivered to clients.

EPISTEMIC HONESTY NOTICE

AION-BRAIN maintains honest convergence states across all frameworks.
Users of this work should know:

    FSVE v3.5    — M-STRONG (30 FCL entries, EV 0.813)
    LAV v1.5     — M-STRONG (45 FCL entries, 77.5% running mean)
    AION v3.0    — M-NASCENT (specified, validation in progress)
    ASL v2.0     — M-NASCENT (specified, validation in progress)
    GENESIS v1.0 — M-NASCENT (specified, validation in progress)
    CDIP v1.5    — M-NASCENT (CEV v1.0 audit complete, FCL pending)
    EID v0.1     — M-NASCENT (specified February 2026, pre-validation)

No framework is represented as more validated than it is.
Certainty engineering means knowing exactly where confidence is
justified and where it is not.

2. ETHICAL USE REQUIRED
   Users agree to maintain ethical safeguards, not use frameworks for
   harassment, manipulation, or deception, and not weaponize epistemic
   infrastructure against vulnerable populations.

3. NO PROFESSIONAL ADVICE
   AION-BRAIN provides cognitive frameworks and reliability methodology,
   not professional advice. All outputs require human verification.
   See: legal/LEGAL-DISCLAIMER.md

4. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
   Users are solely responsible for compliance with applicable regulations
   (HIPAA, GDPR, FDA, SEC, and equivalents) in their jurisdiction.

5. CONVERGENCE STATE TRANSPARENCY
