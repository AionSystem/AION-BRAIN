# About AION-BRAIN

## What is AION-BRAIN?

AION-BRAIN (Artificial Intelligence Operating Network) is an open-source collection of cognitive engines — systematic frameworks for human-AI collaboration that prevent hallucinations, reduce bias, and enforce epistemic humility.

**Mission:** Build cognitive infrastructure for the AI age.

**Vision:** "AION-BRAIN" becomes the standard for enterprise-grade AI safety systems.

## The Problem We Solve

AI makes humans:
- **Overconfident** — Hallucinations mistaken for truth
- **Biased** — Confirmation bias amplified
- **Cognitively lazy** — AI thinks, humans stop learning

Traditional solutions don't work:
- "Prompt engineering tips" = surface-level hacks
- "AI safety research" = too academic, inaccessible
- "Cognitive frameworks" = scattered, not systematic

## The AION-BRAIN Solution

Systematic, contamination-free, epistemically humble frameworks that ANYONE can use.

**No coding required.** Just upload the PDF or paste the prompt into any AI system.

## Engine Architecture

### Tier 1 — Foundation (8 engines)
Meta-level infrastructure that constrains ALL reasoning:
- Oracle Layer v2.1 (PROMETHEUS - Zero-hallucination verification) - **33 tests**
- Benchmark Engine v2.0 (METIS-II - Universal AI safety validation) - **95 tests**
- SIMPLEXITY v2.0 (8-module complexity management) - **59 tests**
- Epistemic Humility Validator v3.1 (Gödel-Turing constraints)
- Meta-Ethical Engine v2.1 (Ethical decision infrastructure)
- Contamination Prevention v1.2 (Bias reduction)
- Uncertainty Quantification Engine
- Reasoning Pattern Catalog

### Tier 2 — Cognitive Architecture (10 engines)
Thinking methodologies for HOW to reason:
- Strategy Engine v1.1 (The Strategist's Edge - 5-framework analysis) - **52 tests**
- Decision Engine v1.0 (DECIDERE - 5-framework decision support) - **53 tests**
- Credibility Engine v2.0 (VERITAS - 7-module trust system) - **53 tests**
- Explanation Engine v1.0 (CLARITAS - 4-generator explainability) - **49 tests**
- GitHub Mastery Engine v1.1 (Open-source success)
- CEREBRO-Lite v1.0 (5-framework pattern recognition)
- Systems Analysis Engine v3.1
- Personality Architect v1.0
- Creativity Engine
- Meta-Learning Engine

### Tier 3 — Domain-Specific (8 engines)
Expert knowledge for specific fields:
- Medical Engine v2.6 (UpToDate + FDA integration)
- Legal Engine v2.2 (Black's Law + Bluebook integration)
- Legal Engine 2 v1.5 (Compliance-focused)
- Regulatory Engine v2.5
- Financial Engine v1.5
- Crisis & Grief Engine v1.5

## Working Python Implementations

Seven flagship engines have full Python implementations with test suites (394 total tests):

| Engine | Codename | Tests | Key Feature |
|--------|----------|-------|-------------|
| Oracle Layer v2.1 | PROMETHEUS | 33 | LLM provider integrations |
| SIMPLEXITY v2.0 | - | 59 | 8 complexity modules |
| Benchmark Engine v2.0 | METIS-II | 95 | Trinity Scoring + Freshness + Audience Reports |
| Strategy Engine v1.1 | The Strategist's Edge | 52 | 5 strategic frameworks |
| Decision Engine v1.0 | DECIDERE | 53 | 5 decision frameworks |
| Credibility Engine v2.0 | VERITAS | 53 | 7 credibility modules |
| Explanation Engine v1.0 | CLARITAS | 49 | 4 explanation generators |

## Core Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Contamination-Free** | Multi-pass independent analysis |
| **Epistemic Humility** | Explicit uncertainty bounds |
| **Ethical Guardrails** | Misuse prevention built-in |
| **Universal Access** | Works without coding |
| **Open Source** | Apache License 2.0, free forever |

## The Architect

**Sheldon K. Salmon (Mr. AION)** built AION-BRAIN during 9 months of isolation in 2025, creating 30 engines, 50 frameworks, and 300+ whitepapers. He released everything open-source in November 2025.

See [ARCHITECT.md](ARCHITECT.md) for the full story.

## Quick Start

1. **Choose an engine** from `/engines/`
2. **Read the spec** (understand the framework)
3. **Copy the prompt** from `*-prompt.md`
4. **Paste into any AI** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
5. **Apply to your problem**

See [QUICK-START-CHEAT-SHEET.md](QUICK-START-CHEAT-SHEET.md) for the 5-minute guide.
