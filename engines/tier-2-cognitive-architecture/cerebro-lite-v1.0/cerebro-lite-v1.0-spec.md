**Parent System:** CEREBRO v3.5 (18-Framework Universal Edition)

---

## Executive Summary

CEREBRO-Lite v1.0 is a streamlined 5-framework pattern recognition engine designed for everyday business decisions and strategic analysis. Unlike the full CEREBRO system (18 frameworks), CEREBRO-Lite applies the 80/20 principle to select the 5 most impactful frameworks that cover 80% of decision-making scenarios.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- Multi-perspective analysis through 5 independent expert lenses
- Contamination-free reasoning (frameworks analyze independently)
- Confidence-calibrated output (STRONG/MODERATE/WEAK)
- Actionable recommendations prioritized by leverage

---

## Tier 2 Classification Rationale

CEREBRO-Lite is classified as **Tier 2 (Cognitive Architecture)** because:

| Criterion | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| **Thinking methodology** | Defines HOW to analyze through 5 frameworks |
| **Domain-agnostic** | Applies to business, personal, strategic decisions |
| **Pattern recognition** | Core function is identifying patterns across perspectives |
| **Synthesis focus** | Combines multiple viewpoints into actionable insights |

**Not Tier 1:** Doesn't constrain other engines (meta-level)  
**Not Tier 3:** Not domain-specific expertise

## Framework Details

### Framework 1: MEADOWS — Leverage Points & Systems Dynamics

**Domain:** System dynamics, feedback loops, intervention design  
**Specialty:** Finds high-leverage points where small changes create large effects

**Core Framework — 12 Leverage Points (Least → Most Powerful):**

| Level | Leverage Point | Power |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| 12 | Constants, parameters, numbers | Weakest |
| 11 | Buffers (sizes of stabilizing stocks) | Low |
| 10 | Stock-and-flow structures | Low |
| 9 | Delays (information & material flows) | Low-Medium |
| 8 | Balancing feedback loops | Medium |
| 7 | Reinforcing feedback loops | Medium |
| 6 | Information flows | Medium-High |
| 5 | Rules of the system | High |
| 4 | Self-organization | High |
| 3 | Goals of the system | Very High |
| 2 | Paradigms (mental models) | Very High |
| 1 | Power to transcend paradigms | Strongest |

**Application:**
- Map stocks, flows, and feedback loops
- Identify system archetypes (Limits to Growth, Shifting the Burden, etc.)
- Recommend interventions at highest feasible leverage level

---

### Framework 2: KAHNEMAN — Cognitive Bias Detection

**Domain:** Behavioral economics, cognitive psychology  
**Specialty:** Identifies systematic thinking errors that lead to poor decisions

**Core Biases Checked:**

| Category | Biases |
|----------|--------|
| **Judgment** | Anchoring, Availability, Representativeness |
| **Memory** | Hindsight, Survivorship |
| **Social** | Groupthink, Authority bias |
| **Self** | Overconfidence, Confirmation bias |
| **Temporal** | Present bias, Sunk cost fallacy |

**System 1 vs System 2:**
- System 1: Fast, intuitive, automatic (bias-prone)
- System 2: Slow, deliberate, analytical (bias-resistant but effortful)

**Application:**
- Scan for evidence of each bias category
- Determine if System 1 or System 2 is driving the decision
- Recommend debiasing interventions

---

### Framework 3: SUN TZU — Strategic Analysis

**Domain:** Competitive strategy, positioning  
**Specialty:** Identifies strategic advantages, vulnerabilities, and optimal positioning

**Core Principles:**

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Know yourself, know your enemy** | Honest self-assessment + competitor analysis |
| **Win without fighting** | Seek positions where conflict is unnecessary |
| **Deception and surprise** | Information asymmetry creates advantage |
| **Terrain analysis** | Understand the competitive landscape |
| **Timing and momentum** | Strike when conditions favor you |

**Strategic Assessment:**
- Position strength (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Competitor vulnerability
- Optimal timing for action
- Information advantages/disadvantages

---

### Framework 4: PEARL — Causal Inference

**Domain:** Statistics, causality, counterfactual reasoning  
**Specialty:** Distinguishes correlation from causation

**Core Tools:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **DAG (Causal Graph)** | Visual representation of causal relationships |
| **do-calculus** | What happens if we INTERVENE (not just observe)? |
| **Counterfactuals** | What WOULD have happened if X had been different? |
| **Confounders** | Variables that affect both cause and effect |

**Causal Ladder:**
1. **Association (seeing):** X and Y occur together
2. **Intervention (doing):** What if we change X?
3. **Counterfactual (imagining):** What if X had been different?

**Application:**
- Map causal relationships
- Identify confounders
- Test causal claims with counterfactual reasoning
- Avoid correlation-causation confusion

---

### Framework 5: TALEB — Anti-Fragility & Stress Testing

**Domain:** Risk management, uncertainty, optionality  
**Specialty:** Tests strategies for robustness under volatility

**Core Concepts:**

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Fragile** | Harmed by volatility (crystal glass) |
| **Robust** | Unchanged by volatility (rubber ball) |
| **Anti-Fragile** | Benefits from volatility (immune system) |

**Key Strategies:**

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Barbell** | 90% safe + 10% risky (avoid fragile middle) |
| **Via Negativa** | Remove fragility > add robustness |
| **Skin in the Game** | Decision-maker bears consequences |
| **Optionality** | Preserve ability to benefit from surprises |

**Stress Test Protocol:**
- 10x demand spike: How does pattern respond?
- 90% demand collapse: Survival probability?
- Key dependency failure: Single points of failure?
- Paradigm shift: Does pattern become obsolete?

## Polymath Enhanced Features (v1.0)

### NEW: Pattern Confidence Decay Calculator

**Purpose:** Tracks how pattern confidence degrades over time as conditions change

**Decay Formula:**
```
Confidence(t) = Initial_Confidence × e^(-λt)
Where:
  λ = decay rate (faster for volatile domains)
  t = time since pattern identification
```

**Domain-Specific Decay Rates:**

| Domain | Half-Life | λ (decay rate) |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Technology trends | 6 months | 0.115 |
| Market dynamics | 12 months | 0.058 |
| Organizational patterns | 24 months | 0.029 |
| Human psychology | 60 months | 0.012 |
| Physical laws | ∞ | 0 |

**Application:**
- Tag each identified pattern with domain
- Calculate time-adjusted confidence
- Flag patterns approaching expiration
- Recommend revalidation schedule

**Output Format:**
```
[PATTERN DECAY ASSESSMENT]
├─ Pattern: [Description]
├─ Initial Confidence: 85%
├─ Domain: Market dynamics
├─ Days Since Identification: 180
├─ Current Confidence: 85% × e^(-0.058 × 0.5) = 82.5%
├─ Expiration Warning: YELLOW (revalidate in 6 months)
└─ Recommendation: Update competitor analysis
```

---

### NEW: Cross-Domain Pattern Bridge

**Purpose:** Identifies when patterns from one domain apply to another domain (analogical reasoning at scale)

**Pattern Mapping Protocol:**
1. **Abstraction:** Extract structural essence from source domain
2. **Mapping:** Find corresponding elements in target domain
3. **Validation:** Test if mapping preserves relationships
4. **Adaptation:** Adjust for domain-specific constraints

**Common Cross-Domain Patterns:**

| Source Domain | Pattern | Target Domain Applications |
|---------------|---------|---------------------------|
| Biology | Immune system | Cybersecurity, organizational resilience |
| Physics | Network effects | Social platforms, marketplace dynamics |
| Evolution | Adaptation | Product-market fit, competitive strategy |
| Ecology | Carrying capacity | Market saturation, resource limits |
| Chemistry | Catalyst | Platform businesses, matchmaking |

**Bridge Strength Assessment:**

| Strength | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **STRONG** | Structural isomorphism + mechanism transfer |
| **MODERATE** | Structural similarity + partial mechanism |
| **WEAK** | Surface analogy only (use with caution) |

**Output Format:**
```
[CROSS-DOMAIN BRIDGE IDENTIFIED]
├─ Source Pattern: Immune system memory (biology)
├─ Target Domain: Cybersecurity
├─ Mapping:
│   ├─ Antigens → Attack signatures
│   ├─ Memory cells → Threat database
│   ├─ Adaptive response → Learning firewall
│   └─ Auto-immunity → False positives
├─ Bridge Strength: STRONG (mechanism transfers)
├─ Adaptation Required: Digital speed (ms vs days)
└─ Novel Insight: Consider "immune tolerance" for reducing false positives
```

## Contamination Prevention Protocol

**Critical Design Principle:** Each framework analyzes INDEPENDENTLY before synthesis

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents confirmation bias across frameworks
- Ensures genuine multi-perspective analysis
- Catches patterns that one framework might miss

**Protocol:**

```
Phase 1: INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS (No Cross-Reference)
├─ Meadows analyzes → Stores findings
├─ Kahneman analyzes → Stores findings
├─ Sun Tzu analyzes → Stores findings
├─ Pearl analyzes → Stores findings
└─ Taleb analyzes → Stores findings

Phase 2: SYNTHESIS (After All Complete)
├─ Compare findings across frameworks
├─ Identify convergence (multiple frameworks agree)
├─ Identify divergence (frameworks disagree)
├─ Flag contradictions for user judgment
└─ Generate meta-patterns
```

---

## Confidence Calibration System

**Pattern Strength Classification:**

| Level | Criteria | Interpretation |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **STRONG** | 3+ frameworks agree | High confidence, act on this |
| **MODERATE** | 2 frameworks agree | Medium confidence, validate further |
| **WEAK** | 1 framework only | Interesting but requires validation |
| **CONTRADICTION** | Frameworks disagree | Requires user judgment |

**Synthesis Output:**
```
[SYNTHESIS]
├─ Convergent Patterns (STRONG signals)
│   └─ [Pattern with 3+ framework support]
├─ Divergent Insights (WEAK signals)
│   └─ [Pattern with 1 framework support]
├─ Contradictions (requires judgment)
│   └─ [Where frameworks disagree]
└─ Meta-Pattern (pattern about the patterns)
    └─ [Higher-order insight]
```
