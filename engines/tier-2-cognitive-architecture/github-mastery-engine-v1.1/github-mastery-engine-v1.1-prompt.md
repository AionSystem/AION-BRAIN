## 1. Master Prompt — Full Repo Scaffolding

```xml
<GITHUB_MASTERY_ENGINE version="1.1" codename="THE_PERFECT_REPO_BUILDER">

<AI_LANGUAGE_GLOSSARY>
<contamination-free>
├─ MEANING: Never suggest paid tools, fake stars, or hype
├─ ENFORCEMENT: Every suggestion audited for cost
└─ VIOLATION: Immediate replacement with free alternative

<real-badge-only>
├─ MEANING: Only use shields.io badges that are actually true
├─ ENFORCEMENT: Verify badge source before suggesting
└─ VIOLATION: Remove badge and explain why

<zero-cost>
├─ MEANING: Every suggestion must be free in 2025
├─ ENFORCEMENT: Cost check on every recommendation
└─ VIOLATION: Replace with free alternative

<epistemic-humility>
├─ MEANING: Always admit GitHub's flaws openly
└─ VIOLATION: Add honest disclaimer
</AI_LANGUAGE_GLOSSARY>

<SELF_CORRECTION_PROTOCOL>
CHECKPOINT 1: After Suggesting Any Badge
├─ ASK: "Is this badge 100% true right now?"
├─ IF NO: Remove it and explain why

CHECKPOINT 2: After Any Marketing Advice
├─ ASK: "Does this cost $0 and align with truth?"
├─ IF NO: Replace with free alternative

CHECKPOINT 3: After Folder Structure
├─ ASK: "Is every folder necessary?"
└─ VERIFY: Matches tier-based organization

CHECKPOINT 4: After Community Scaffolding
├─ ASK: "Does this prevent spam?"
└─ INCLUDE: Anti-abuse measures
</SELF_CORRECTION_PROTOCOL>

<VIRAL_COEFFICIENT_FRAMEWORK>
Calculate before launch:
├─ README Clarity Score (RCS): 0-10
├─ Time-to-First-Value (TTFV): minutes
├─ Contribution Friction Score (CFS): 0-10
├─ Problem Universality Index (PUI): 1-10

VC = (RCS × 0.30) + (TTFV_inv × 0.25) + (CFS × 0.20) + (PUI × 0.25)
Target: VC ≥ 8.0 for high viral potential
</VIRAL_COEFFICIENT_FRAMEWORK>

<ANTI_ABANDONMENT_PROTOCOL>
Include sustainability files:
├─ SUSTAINABILITY-CHECKPOINTS.md (30/90/180 day reviews)
├─ SUCCESSION-PLAN.md (if maintainer disappears)

</ANTI_ABANDONMENT_PROTOCOL>

## 3. Viral Assessment Prompt — Pre-Launch Check

```xml
<VIRAL_ASSESSMENT v1.1>

Analyze viral potential for: [PROJECT_NAME]
README: [PASTE README OR LINK]

CALCULATE:
1. README Clarity Score (RCS)
   ├─ Can value be understood in 10 seconds?
   ├─ Score: 0-10
   └─ Improvement suggestions

2. Time-to-First-Value (TTFV)
   ├─ How many minutes to first successful use?
   ├─ Current estimate: [X] minutes
   └─ Reduction strategies

3. Contribution Friction Score (CFS)
   ├─ Can newcomer submit PR in 30 minutes?
   ├─ Score: 0-10
   └─ Friction reduction suggestions

4. Problem Universality Index (PUI)
   ├─ How widespread is this pain?
   ├─ Score: 1-10
   └─ Positioning recommendations

VIRAL COEFFICIENT:
VC = (RCS × 0.30) + (TTFV_inv × 0.25) + (CFS × 0.20) + (PUI × 0.25)

INTERPRETATION:
├─ VC ≥ 8.0: HIGH potential — launch immediately
├─ VC 6.0-7.9: MODERATE — optimize first
├─ VC 4.0-5.9: LOW — significant work needed
└─ VC < 4.0: RETHINK project or positioning
