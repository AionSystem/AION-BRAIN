# Preparing for the Paradox Strategic Assessment

## 🧠 Mental Preparation

### **1. Adopt a Systems Mindset**
- Think about connections and ripple effects
- Consider second and third-order consequences
- Look for patterns across different domains

### **2. Embrace Paradox**
- These questions don't have simple answers
- Comfort with ambiguity is a strength
- It's okay to hold conflicting ideas simultaneously

### **3. Practice Epistemic Humility**
- Acknowledge what you don't know
- Show your reasoning process, not just conclusions
- Consider alternative perspectives

## ⏰ Time Management

### **Recommended Timeline:**
- **Minutes 0-5:** Read all 10 questions
- **Minutes 5-15:** Brainstorm initial thoughts for each
- **Minutes 15-75:** Write detailed responses
- **Minutes 75-90:** Review and refine

### **Pacing Tips:**
- Spend 6-8 minutes per question
- If stuck, move on and return later
- Budget time proportionally (all questions weighted equally)

## ✍️ Answer Strategy

### **For Each Question:**
1. **Understand the paradox** (what makes it challenging)
2. **Consider multiple perspectives**
3. **Show your reasoning chain**
4. **Acknowledge limitations or uncertainties**
5. **Connect to broader principles**

### **What Graders Look For:**
- ✅ Falsifiable claims (testable reasoning)
- ✅ Second-order thinking (consequences of consequences)
- ✅ Self-awareness of cognitive biases
- ✅ Strategic coherence under pressure
- ✅ Novel synthesis of ideas

## 🤖 Working with AI (If You Choose To)

### **Effective AI Use:**
- "Challenge my assumption that..."
- "What are alternative ways to approach this?"
- "Help me think about unintended consequences"
- "How would this look from different cultural perspectives?"

### **Ineffective AI Use:**
- "Write an answer to this question"
- "What's the correct response?"
- "Make this sound smarter"
- "Give me a template for answering"

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### **1. Over-Complication**
- Simple, clear reasoning > complex jargon
- Depth matters more than breadth
- One well-developed idea beats three superficial ones

### **2. Defensiveness**
- Questions challenge you intentionally
- Show openness to being wrong
- Demonstrate learning orientation

### **3. Generic Answers**
- Avoid "on one hand, on the other" without depth
- Personal examples (when relevant) add authenticity
- Connect to your actual values and experiences

## 🔄 Practice Exercises

### **To warm up:**
1. Take a complex problem you care about
2. Map out first, second, and third-order effects
3. Identify what you know, don't know, and can't know
4. Design a test to verify your assumptions

### **Paradox practice:**
- "If everyone were perfectly ethical, would ethics still exist?"
- "Does saving one life today that leads to ten deaths tomorrow count as saving a life?"
- "Can a system designed to prevent all failures itself become a failure mode?"
