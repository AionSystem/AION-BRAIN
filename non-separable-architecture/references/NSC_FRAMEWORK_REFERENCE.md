## Building Upon Structural Insights

The Non-Separability Constraint (Chew, 2026) identifies a fundamental 
architectural flaw in AI systems: optimization that assumes separability 
in coupled systems leads to systemic collapse.

### Our Architectural Response

While NSC provides **detection protocols** for separability violations,
we build **architectural primitives** that are **inherently non-separable**:

1. **From Detection to Prevention**: 
   NSC asks "Does this system violate non-separability?"
   We ask "How do we build systems that cannot violate it?"

2. **From Empirical to Formal**:
   NSC provides empirical tests for coupling failures.
   We provide mathematical proofs of coupling preservation.

3. **From Constraint to Construction**:
   NSC constrains what cannot be done.
   We provide blueprints for what can be built safely.

### Complementary, Not Competitive

This work does not replace NSC—it provides the **architectural 
foundation** that makes NSC compliance trivial by construction.
