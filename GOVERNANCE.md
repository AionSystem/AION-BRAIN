# Governance

## Project Structure

**Architect (Benevolent Dictator):**
- Sheldon K. Salmon (Mr. AION)
- Final decision on core repository merges
- Vision setting and long-term direction
- New engine releases and major version decisions

**Core Maintainers (To be recruited):**
- Review pull requests

**Community Contributors:**
- Submit PRs, report bugs, create forks
- Write tutorials and case studies
- Develop derivative engines

## Decision-Making Process

### Minor Changes
*Typos, examples, formatting*

- Fast review (24-48 hours)
- No community discussion required

### Major Changes
*New frameworks, structural changes, new engines*
- Community discussion (GitHub Discussions)
- Minimum 7-day comment period
- Architect makes final decision
- Transparent reasoning provided

### Community Priorities
*Which engines to add next, feature requests*
- Community votes via GitHub Discussions
- Architect considers votes but not bound by them
- Roadmap updated quarterly
- Transparency about what influences decisions

## Evolution of Governance

This governance model will evolve as the community grows:

- **< 100 contributors**: Current model (Architect-led)
- **100-500 contributors**: Expanded maintainer council
- **500+ contributors**: Consider formal steering committee

Governance changes require:
- 30-day community discussion
- Architect approval
- Documentation of rationale
