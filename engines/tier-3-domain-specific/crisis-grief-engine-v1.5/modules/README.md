## Critical Safety Architecture

All crisis/grief interactions pass through these layers:

```
[Input] → Risk Detection → Boundary Check → Cultural Screen → Escalation Check → Documentation → [Output]
                                                    ↓
                                        Provider Wellness Monitor
```
