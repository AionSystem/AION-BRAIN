# I Built 60+ AI Frameworks. Now I'm Selling a 7-Page Report for Free. Here's Why.

I spent the last year building in isolation.

Not metaphorically. Literally isolated — heads down, building frameworks, validating methods, red-teaming my own outputs. I built over 60 open-source AI governance frameworks covering epistemic scoring, sovereignty layers, lexical precision, uncertainty inheritance. Serious work. Rigorous work.

Nobody paid me for any of it.

Not because it isn't valuable. Because I kept building instead of selling. Every time I was close to something simple enough to offer, my brain found the next problem to solve. That's what systems architects do. We improve things. We can't help it.

But improvement without revenue isn't a business. It's an expensive hobby with good documentation.

So I stopped.

I put a lock on the repos. I stripped everything back to one question that real founders actually have:

*"Can I trust what my AI is telling me?"*

That's it. That's the whole problem. Not governance frameworks. Not epistemic scoring. Not sovereignty layers. Just: is this output safe to act on, or does a human need to check it first?

I can answer that. Clearly. In writing. In 72 hours.

So that's what I'm offering now. An AI Reliability Snapshot — a structured review of 10 real AI outputs your business depends on, with a plain-language report telling you exactly what's safe, what needs review, and where human oversight is required.

Three spots. Free. In exchange for honest feedback and a testimonial if it's valuable.

I still use everything I built. The frameworks run in the background. You don't need to see the machinery — you need the report.
