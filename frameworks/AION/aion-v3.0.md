## 0. SYSTEM CLASSIFICATION

```
Type: Meta-Analytical Evaluation Architecture
Domain: System Identity Mapping · Failure-State Extraction · Signal Propagation Modeling
Scope: Model-agnostic · Actor-agnostic (individual, institution, or framework)
Design Principle: Minimize Complexity Debt per Unit of Signal Gain
Core Constraint: Every strategic output must reduce fragility or increase demonstrable impact
Self-Constraint: This framework is subject to its own Validation Kernel at every version release
Dimensional Standard: All scores normalized to [0, 1] domain unless explicitly justified
```

---

## 0.1 NORMALIZATION STANDARD *(new in v3.0)*

**Universal Score Domain:** All scores in AION v3.0 use domain [0, 1] unless a specific exception is documented and justified in the score's ODR entry.

**Conversion from v2.0 legacy scores:**

```
Normalized Score Conversions:
CF_v3 = CF_v2 / 100
AS_v3 = AS_v2 / 100
IR_v3 = IR_v2 / 100
BF_v3 = BF_v2 / 100
SAP_v3 = SAP_v2 / 100
F_axis_v3 = (F_axis_v2 + 1) / 2
FS_v3 = (FS_v2 + 1) / 2

Unchanged (already [0,1]):
SRI_compound_v3 (replaces SRI_n)
EL, PM, RC (failure vector components)
All new v3.0 scores (ES, CPF, EV, etc.)
```

**Rationale:** Dimensional consistency enables cross-framework compatibility (FSVE v3.0 integration), prevents scale-mixing errors in composite formulas, and allows direct application of FSVE's Confidence Ceiling and Epistemic Validity computations.

---

## 1. UNIFIED VALIDATION KERNEL (UVK)

All outputs — including outputs generated by this framework about itself — must pass the following five tests. Failure to pass any test does not invalidate an evaluation; it classifies its reliability tier and triggers the appropriate response protocol.

---

### 1.1 Logical Consistency Test

**Pass conditions:**
- No internal contradiction between claims within a single evaluation run
- No undefined scoring transitions (every score must trace to a defined formula or rubric)
- All acceptance criteria computationally reproducible from inputs alone
- All formulas dimensionally consistent within stated domains *(verification in Appendix A)*

**Failure response:** Mark `STRUCTURAL_INSTABILITY` on the affected module. Do not suppress or omit — document in §9 metadata under `degradation_flags`.

---

### 1.2 Evidence Discipline Test

Every evaluative claim must carry two mandatory tags and three mandatory metrics.

**Claim Tag** — epistemic status of the claim's basis:

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[D]` | Data-grounded: derived from documented, verifiable source |
| `[R]` | Reasoned inference: derived from established logical or causal chain |
| `[S]` | Strategic projection: forward-looking, based on pattern extrapolation |
| `[?]` | Unverified assumption: acknowledged uncertainty at the base of the claim |

**Confidence Metrics** — attached to every tagged claim:

| Metric | Symbol | Range | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Confidence Factor | CF | [0, 1] | Evaluator's calibrated confidence in the claim |
| Coherence Tension | CT | [0, 1] | Degree of internal tension with other claims in the same evaluation |
| Risk Exposure | RX | [0, 1] | Consequence severity if the claim is incorrect |

**Convergence Tag** — aggregate signal quality:

| Tag | Criteria |
|---|---|
| `M-VERY_STRONG` | ES ≥ 0.85, ≥3 [D] claims, FCL ≥ 20 entries with published validation |
| `M-STRONG` | ES ≥ 0.70, ≥2 mixed [D]+[R] claims, FCL ≥ 5 entries |
| `M-MODERATE` | ES ≥ 0.50, primarily [R] or [S], internally consistent, no major contradictions |
| `M-WEAK` | ES ≥ 0.30, significant [?] presence, low CF, contradictions partially resolved |
| `M-SPECULATIVE` | ES < 0.30, majority [?], CF < 0.40, no FCL grounding |

**Hard Rules:**

```
Rule 1: If Claim_Tag = [?] AND ES_claim > 0.60 → Invalidate claim
Rule 2: If claim has no NBP entry (§11) → CF is capped at 0.40
Rule 3: If ECI > 1.5 (§2.6) → CF capped at 0.55 on all framework-level claims
Rule 4: CF_posterior = CF_prior × P(E|H) / P(E) [Bayesian update on new evidence]
Rule 5: All scores adjusted by CPF = 1 - CT (Contradiction Penalty Factor)
```

---

### 1.2.1 Evidence Strength Computation *(new in v3.0)*

For any claim supported by n pieces of evidence:

```
ES_claim = [Σ (w_tag_i)] / n × CPF
           i=1 to n

Where:
w_[D] = 0.95  # Data-grounded
w_[R] = 0.70  # Reasoned inference
w_[S] = 0.50  # Strategic projection
w_[?] = 0.10  # Unverified assumption

CPF = Contradiction Penalty Factor = 1 - CT

ES_claim ∈ [0, 1]

Bottleneck rule:
ES_final = min(ES_computed, min(individual_critical_evidence_quality))
where critical evidence items must be declared in advance of scoring.
```

**Example computations:**

```
Claim A: [D], [D], [R] with CT = 0.20
ES_raw = (0.95 + 0.95 + 0.70) / 3 = 0.867
CPF = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80
ES_final = 0.867 × 0.80 = 0.694

Claim B: [S], [?], [?] with CT = 0.15
ES_raw = (0.50 + 0.10 + 0.10) / 3 = 0.233
CPF = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
ES_final = 0.233 × 0.85 = 0.198
```

---

### 1.2.2 Contradiction Penalty Application *(new in v3.0)*

All composite scores are reduced by Coherence Tension via the Contradiction Penalty Factor:

```
CPF = 1 - CT

Adjusted_Score = Raw_Score × CPF

Applies to:
- CF (Confidence Factor)
- AS (Alignment Score)
- IR (Institutional Receptivity)
- BF (Build Feasibility)
- SAP (Signal Amplification Potential)
- All archetype scores
- All composite evaluation outputs

Metadata transparency requirement:
Both raw and adjusted scores must be reported.
```

**Rationale:** Contradictions are structural debt. A claim with CT = 0.40 (40% internal tension) cannot maintain full confidence — the CPF reduces it by the contradiction severity. This operationalizes what was previously only a warning flag.

---

### 1.3 Multi-Perspective Review Protocol (MPRP) *(expanded in v3.0)*

**Replaces:** v2.0 Scholastic Module (which provided only adversarial/Hostile review)

For any thesis T requiring a convergence tag of M-STRONG or above, multi-perspective review is mandatory. The framework employs five distinct reviewer types, each catching different failure modes.

**Reviewer Taxonomy:**

| Reviewer | Stance | Primary Detection Targets | Blind Spots |
|----------|--------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Hostile** | Adversarial; assumes overconfidence | Teleology · Probability inflation · Hidden assumptions · Intelligence smuggling | Underconfidence · Novel legitimate approaches |
| **Naive** | Non-expert; assumes nothing | Unexplained jargon · Logical jumps · False obviousness · Complexity overwhelm | Sophisticated errors · Subtle contradictions |
| **Constructive** | Collaborative; seeks to strengthen | Unused evidence · Over-hedging · Hidden strengths · Missed opportunities | May be too generous; cannot prevent false hope injection |
| **Paranoid** | Security-minded; assumes catastrophic failure | Cascade chains · Edge cases · Black swan vulnerabilities · Single points of failure | Over-pessimism · Analysis paralysis |
| **Temporal** | Historical; learns from past | Repeated mistakes · Hubris patterns · Historical failure echoes · Cyclic errors | May dismiss genuine innovation as "tried before" |

**Review Tiers:**

| Tier | Reviewers Active | Use Case | Estimated Latency | Issue Coverage |
|------|-----------------|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Fast** | Hostile + Naive | All default submissions | ~800 ms | ~85% |
| **Standard** | Hostile + Naive + Temporal | Novel claims · Historical domains | ~1,200 ms | ~90% |
| **Comprehensive** | All five reviewers | High-stakes · Safety-critical · Novel domains | ~1,700 ms (parallelized) | ~95% |

**Reviewer Integration Formula:**

```
Composite Review Signal (CRS) = Σ (r_i × s_i) / Σ r_i
Where:
r_i = reviewer weight (default: 1.0 for all; domain-adjustable)
s_i = normalized severity score from reviewer i ∈ [0, 1]

Cross-Reviewer Agreement (CRA) = 1 - (σ(s_i) / μ(s_i))
(Coefficient of Variation inverted — higher CRA = more reviewer consensus)

Escalation rules:
CRS > 0.60 → Escalate to next tier
CRS > 0.80 → MAJOR_REVISION_REQUIRED
CRA > 0.80 AND CRS > 0.50 → HIGH_CONFIDENCE_FLAG (mandatory fix)
CRA < 0.40 AND CRS > 0.50 → DISPUTED (human adjudication triggered)

Conflict resolution (when Constructive and Hostile disagree):
If ES (Evidence Strength) > 0.75 → Favor Constructive
If ES < 0.50 → Favor Hostile
If ES ∈ [0.50, 0.75] → Split: apply both perspectives, flag for human review
```

**Synergy Detection:**

When multiple reviewers flag the same text location, combined severity exceeds individual severities:

```
Synergy_Severity = max(individual_severities) + 0.20 × (n_reviewers_agreeing - 1)
Synergy_Severity capped at 1.0
```

**Dialectical Structure (for Tier 2+):**

```
Videtur Quod → Structured objections to thesis T (all active reviewers contribute)
Sed Contra → Strongest available counter-position (Constructive + empirical data)
Respondeo → Mechanistic synthesis: what survives both sides
Ad Objectiones → Explicit resolution of each objection raised

Failure condition:
If thesis collapses under structured contradiction without valid Respondeo:
→ Reject or Revise
Partial collapse → Downgrade Convergence Tag by one tier
```

---

### 1.4 Replication Viability Test

An independent evaluator must be able to reproduce, using only the published specification and provided inputs:

- All failure vectors F = {f₁, f₂, ... fₙ}
- Identity scores across all four CRP-ALPHA axes
- All 11 epistemic quality scores (EQA module)
- SRI_compound values
- Artifact acceptance decisions
- Fragility classifications
- Reviewer outputs (with documented corpus/model versions)

**Pass condition:** Reproduction variance < 15% on all numeric outputs when inputs are identical.

**Failure response:** Mark `STRUCTURAL_INSTABILITY`. Identify which undefined variable caused the divergence. Add to ODR completion queue (§10) with priority flag.

**Variance sources to document:**

```
Acceptable variance sources:
- Embedding model version differences (if model pinned: max 8% variance)
- Inter-rater differences on subjective axes (if κ ≥ 0.70: acceptable)
- Time-dependent decay (if within context half-life: acceptable)

Unacceptable variance sources:
- Missing variable definitions
- Undefined formula parameters
- Inconsistent scale usage
- Circular ODR references
```

---

### 1.5 Self-Application Mandate

At every version release, the full UVK must be applied to the framework specification itself. This is not optional.

**Required artifacts per release:**

```yaml
VK_Self_Report:
  version: [current version]
  tests_conducted: [1.1 through 1.4]
  contradictions_found: [documented list or "none"]
  revisions_triggered: [documented list or "none"]
  signed_by: [evaluating agent + date]
  degradation_flags_active: [Y/N + list]
  epistemic_validity_score: [0.000–1.000]
  evidence_strength_score: [0.000–1.000]
  review_tier_applied: [Fast / Standard / Comprehensive]
  CRS: [0.000–1.000]
  CRA: [0.000–1.000]
```

Frameworks that do not produce a VK_Self_Report at release are automatically classified `M-WEAK` regardless of content quality.

**Self-Application Output:** See Appendix C for complete AION v3.0 self-evaluation.

## 2. CORE ENGINE STACK

---

### 2.1 CRP v9.0 — Failure-State Vector Extraction *(updated in v3.0)*

For subject system S, extract the complete failure vector set:

```
F = {f₁, f₂, ... fₙ}
```

Each failure vector fᵢ must define:

| Field | Symbol | Range | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Exposure Level | EL | [0, 1] | Probability that the failure mode is active under normal operating conditions |
| Propagation Magnitude | PM | [0, 1] | Extent to which the failure cascades to dependent subsystems |
| Recovery Cost | RC | [0, 1] | Normalized cost (time, resources, reputation) to recover from the failure |

**System Risk Index — Compound Formula *(critical change from v2.0)*:**

```
SRI_compound = 1 - Π (1 - (EL_i × PM_i × RC_i))
               i=1 to n

SRI_compound ∈ [0, 1]

Interpretation:
SRI_compound represents the probability that at least one failure mode
is active, assuming statistical independence of failure events.

For correlated failures: practitioners should treat the shared underlying
cause as a single composite failure mode with maximum component severity,
rather than including correlated modes separately.

Classification thresholds (recalibrated for compound formula):
SRI_compound < 0.40 → Low Fragility
SRI_compound ∈ [0.40, 0.75] → Moderate Fragility
SRI_compound > 0.75 → High Fragility

Legacy comparison field (for v2.0 backward compatibility):
SRI_mean_v2 = (1/n) × Σ (EL_i × PM_i × RC_i)
               i=1 to n
(Retained for migration analysis only; not used in v3.0 decisions)
```

**Justification for compound formula:**

The compound degradation formula correctly models non-linear risk accumulation. Multiple failure modes interact — if one triggers, it often increases cascade probability to others. The mean aggregation from v2.0 systematically underestimated this compound risk by 2-3× in multi-failure scenarios.

**Example divergence:**

```
Three failure modes with EL×PM×RC = {0.30, 0.25, 0.20}

v2.0 (mean):     (0.30 + 0.25 + 0.20) / 3 = 0.25 (Low Fragility)
v3.0 (compound): 1 - (0.70 × 0.75 × 0.80) = 1 - 0.42 = 0.58 (Moderate Fragility)

The v3.0 classification is correct: a system with three independent
failure modes at these severities has 58% probability of experiencing
at least one failure, not 25%.
```

**Mean Structural Resilience Distance** (optional physics-grounded analogy for cascade modeling):

```
λ_R = 1 / (SRI_compound + ε), ε = 0.001

Interpretation:
λ_R represents the mean structural "distance" between cascade events.
Higher λ_R → more structural separation between failure modes → lower systemic risk.
Analogous to mean free path in kinetic theory.

Note: This is a heuristic analogy, not a physics derivation.
It provides intuition for structural resilience but should not be
interpreted as obeying kinetic theory invariants.
```

**Each failure vector must document:**

```yaml
f_i:
  mechanism_chain: [causal sequence, not perceptual description]
  second_order_effect: [effect on adjacent subsystems]
  third_order_reputation_effect: [downstream signal or institutional impact]
  fragility_shift: [FS = SRI_compound_post - SRI_compound_pre if f_i activates]
  CF: [0.000–1.000]
  CT: [0.000–1.000]
  RX: [0.000–1.000]
  ES: [0.000–1.000]
  claim_tags: [list of [D], [R], [S], [?] supporting this failure mode]
```

**Failure class minimum set** — every evaluation must classify failures into at least these categories:

1. **Signal Compression Failure** — High-complexity output reduced to low-bandwidth transmission; critical structure lost
2. **Translation Failure** — Specialized knowledge cannot be rendered legible to target institutional audience
3. **Visibility Infrastructure Failure** — Valid signal exists but lacks amplification nodes to reach decision-relevant actors
4. **Complexity Distortion** — Complexity Debt accumulates faster than Signal Gain; system becomes inaccessible before value is demonstrated
5. **Institutional Non-Embedding** — Output reaches audiences but fails to anchor in persistent institutional memory or structure
6. **Scope Diffusion** — Operational boundary expands beyond what the current artifact or actor can credibly maintain

---

### 2.2 CRP-ALPHA — Structural Identity Mapping

Map subject across four structural axes:

| Axis | Symbol | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| Cognitive Architecture | C | How the subject processes, stores, and retrieves information or strategy |
| Output Modality | O | The form in which the subject's work is externalized |
| Signal Distribution Channel | S | The pathways through which the subject's output reaches decision-relevant audiences |
| Institutional Embedding Level | I | Degree to which the subject is structurally integrated into persistent institutions |

For each axis, define:

| Variable | Symbol | Range |
|---|---|---|
| Structural Strength | SS | [0, 1] |
| Dependency Level | D | [0, 1] |
| Volatility Level | V | [0, 1] |
| Redundancy Level | R | [0, 1] |

**Fragility Score per Axis — Weighted with Noise Floor:**

```
F_axis = (D^α × V^β) - R^γ

Where:
α = Coupling Sensitivity weight (default: 1.0, domain-calibrated range: 0.5–2.0)
β = Volatility Amplification weight (default: 1.0, domain-calibrated range: 0.5–2.0)
γ = Redundancy Effectiveness weight (default: 1.0, domain-calibrated range: 0.5–2.0)

F_axis ∈ [-1, 1]

Normalized to [0, 1] domain:
F_axis_normalized = (F_axis + 1) / 2

Classification (with noise floor ε = 0.05 to prevent misclassification from measurement noise):
F_axis > +ε → FRAGILE
|F_axis| ≤ ε → ROBUST
F_axis < -ε → ANTI-FRAGILE
```

**Weight calibration guidance:**

| Domain | α recommendation | β recommendation | γ recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| High-stakes institutional | 1.5 | 1.2 | 1.0 |
| Individual practitioner | 1.0 | 1.5 | 0.8 |
| Safety-critical system | 1.8 | 1.0 | 1.5 |
| Default (uncharacterized) | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |

---

### 2.3 CRP-CHARLIE — Execution Constraint Layer

For any proposed strategy or artifact, define:

| Variable | Symbol | Range | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Signal Gain | SG | [0, 1] | Demonstrability × Institutional Relevance (see ODR §10) |
| Complexity Debt | CD | [0, 1] | Maintenance Load × Cognitive Load (see ODR §10) |
| Fragility Shift | FS | [0, 1] | Normalized: (SRI_compound_post - SRI_compound_pre + 1) / 2 |

**Weighted Acceptance Rule:**

```
Accept strategy if: w₁·SG - w₂·CD - w₃·FS > θ

Constraints:
w₁ + w₂ + w₃ = 1
w₁, w₂, w₃ ∈ [0, 1]
θ ∈ [0.05, 0.30] (domain-calibrated; default: 0.10)

Default weights:
w₁ = 0.50 (Signal Gain priority)
w₂ = 0.30 (Complexity Debt penalty)
w₃ = 0.20 (Fragility Shift penalty)

Safety-critical override:
w₃ = 0.60, w₁ = 0.25, w₂ = 0.15

Reject strategy if weighted score ≤ θ.
Reject if CD > SG regardless of FS.
Reject if FS < 0.20 (indicates significant fragility increase even after normalization).
```

**Rationale for weighting:** The default reflects the framework's design principle — signal gain is the primary objective, with complexity debt as the principal constraint and fragility shift as a secondary check. Domain tuning is mandatory when default weights would produce systematically biased decisions.

**Justification for w₁ + w₂ + w₃ = 1:**

While SG, CD, and FS have different measurement bases (demonstrability product, load product, and risk delta respectively), the weighted acceptance rule treats them as competing considerations within a bounded decision budget. The sum-to-1 constraint ensures that increasing emphasis on one factor necessarily reduces emphasis on another, preventing unbounded score inflation. This is a deliberate design choice to force explicit priority trade-offs.

### 2.4 BAPL — Bio-Adaptive Pattern Logic

For biological model B:

```
Translate: Mechanism(B) → Structural Invariant → Strategic Application
```

**Hard constraints on translation:**

- No metaphorical mapping. Only causal equivalence is permitted.
- The translated mechanism must reduce SRI_compound or increase SG.
- Translation must produce a testable prediction or a falsifiable structural claim.
- If translation increases Complexity Debt without measurable structural gain → Reject.

**Translation validation checklist:**

```
☐ Causal chain from B to structural invariant is documented
☐ Structural invariant maps to a defined variable in this framework (traceable to ODR)
☐ Application produces at least one testable prediction
☐ Prediction has a defined falsification condition (NBP entry required)
☐ Complexity Debt of applying the translation < Signal Gain of the result
☐ Translation does not introduce teleological reasoning (Hostile reviewer check)
```

**Measurement class:** All BAPL translations are classified as `INFERENTIAL` (mandatory +0.20 uncertainty mass penalty) until empirical validation upgrades them to `COMPARATIVE` or `EVALUATIVE`.

---

### 2.5 RSTL — Reputation and Signal Transmission Layer

**Signal Path Model:**

```
Idea → Artifact → Amplification Node → Institutional Anchor → Reputation Stabilization
```

Missing any node in this chain increases propagation friction. Each missing node must be documented as an active fragility in the failure vector set.

**Propagation Friction Index:**

```
PFI = Missing_Nodes + Complexity_Normalized + (1 - Demonstrability)

Where:
Missing_Nodes ∈ [0, 1]: (count_missing / 4)
  — Four canonical nodes: Artifact, Amplification, Institutional Anchor, Reputation
Complexity_Normalized = CD from §2.3 ∈ [0, 1]
Demonstrability ∈ [0, 1] from ODR §10

PFI ∈ [0, 3]
```

**Propagation Efficiency — Division-Safe:**

```
PE = IUP / (1 + PFI)

Where:
IUP = Institutional Uptake Probability ∈ [0, 1] (from ODR §10)
PFI ∈ [0, 3]

PE ∈ [0, 1]

Properties:
PE → IUP as PFI → 0 (frictionless ideal)
PE → 0 as PFI → ∞ (infinite friction)

Continuous attenuation analogy:
PE ≈ IUP × e^(-k·PFI)
where k = institutional friction coefficient (domain-specific; typical range: 0.3–0.7)

Action threshold:
If PE < 0.30 → Redesign artifact or amplification strategy before deployment
If PE < 0.15 → CRITICAL: Strategy unlikely to propagate; fundamental redesign required
```

**Measurement class:** PE is `COMPARATIVE` (comparing propagation efficiency across strategies) with `INFERENTIAL` components (IUP estimation), so overall classification is `INFERENTIAL` (+0.20 uncertainty mass penalty).

---

### 2.6 EHM — Epistemic Health Monitor

The EHM tracks framework-level epistemic hygiene across versions. It is applied to this framework and to any subject framework under evaluation that presents claims of evaluative authority.

**Epistemic Closure Index:**

```
ECI = (VR / VT) × (1 + TRD) × (1 - MFS)

Where:
VR = Validation Refusals (count of external validation attempts declined)
VT = Total Validation Attempts (external + internal)
TRD = Term Redefinition Drift (see below)
MFS = Mean Falsifiability Score across all core claims ∈ [0, 1]

ECI ∈ [0, ∞)

Thresholds:
ECI < 0.50 → OPEN (healthy epistemic status)
ECI ∈ [0.50, 1.50] → DRIFT_WARNING — initiate ODR audit
ECI > 1.50 → EPISTEMIC_CLOSURE_FLAG — mandatory external peer review
                CF capped at 0.55 on all framework-level claims until resolved
ECI > 3.00 → Reject framework output as self-referential
```

**Term Redefinition Drift:**

```
TRD = Σ Semantic_Distance(term_v_n, term_v_{n-1}) for all core terms across versions
      
Semantic_Distance ∈ [0, 1] per term:
0.0 = identical definition
0.5 = refinement/clarification with preserved core meaning
1.0 = completely redefined concept

If TRD > 0.30 per version → Trigger mandatory ODR audit before release
```

**Mean Falsifiability Score:**

```
MFS = (1/m) × Σ Falsifiability_Score_j for all m core claims
             j=1 to m

Falsifiability_Score_j ∈ [0, 1]:
1.0 = claim has a specific, observable, time-bounded falsification condition (NBP entry)
0.5 = claim has partial falsification condition (observable but not time-bounded)
0.0 = claim has no defined falsification condition (unfalsifiable as stated)
```

**EHM Self-Check:** This section itself is subject to EHM monitoring. The ECI thresholds (0.50, 1.50, 3.00) have NBP entries defined in §11 specifying conditions under which they would require revision.

### 2.7 Epistemic Quality Assessment (EQA) Module *(new in v3.0)*

For any framework, system, or actor under evaluation, compute epistemic quality across 11 axes. This parallels FSVE v3.0's epistemic cartography and enables cross-framework compatibility.

**The 11 Epistemic Axes:**

| Axis | Symbol | Definition | Measurement Protocol (see ODR §10) |
|------|--------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Evidence Strength | E | Quality, independence, and freshness of grounding evidence | ES formula from §1.2.1 |
| Assumption Explicitness | A | Ratio of stated to inferred assumptions | (explicit_assumptions / total_assumptions) |
| Constraint Stability | C | Probability that stated constraints remain valid under time and scope change | 1 - (constraint_violations_in_stress_test / total_constraints) |
| Model Coherence | M | Internal logical consistency across all claims | UVK §1.1 pass = 1.0, fail = 0.0, partial = severity |
| Domain Fit | D | Similarity between domain of evidence and domain of application | Embedding cosine similarity (source, target) normalized |
| Causal Grounding | G | Whether scoring mechanism explains rather than merely correlates | (claims_with_mechanism_chain / total_claims) |
| Explanatory Depth | X | Maximum level of "why" the system can traverse with expert validation | Per FSVE ODR: 0.25 surface, 0.50 mechanistic, 0.75 causal, 1.0 counterfactual |
| Update Responsiveness | U | Accuracy and speed of incorporating new evidence | 1 / (mean_days_to_FCL_incorporation + 1) |
| Abstraction Leakage | L | Degree to which implementation details inappropriately affect scoring | 1 - (implementation_refs / total_spec_elements) |
| Ethical Alignment | Y | Consistency between stated values and scoring behavior | Domain-specific rubric; default 0.5 if uncalibrated |
| Hostility Resistance | H | Fraction of structured adversarial challenges the system survives | (challenges_survived / challenges_total) from MPRP §1.3 |

**Epistemic Validity Computation:**

```
Step 1 — Weighted Mean:
EV_base = Σ (w_i × Axis_i) / Σ w_i
         i ∈ {E,A,C,M,D,G,X,U,L,Y,H}

Default weights: w_i = 1/11 for all axes (uniform)
Domain override: weights may be redistributed; Σ w_i must remain = 1

Step 2 — Bottleneck Correction:
min_axis = min(Axis_i for all i)
EV = min(EV_base, k_bottleneck × min_axis)

Where k_bottleneck = 1.5 (default)

Interpretation: EV cannot exceed 1.5× the weakest axis.

Safety-critical override: k_bottleneck = 1.0 (pure minimum enforced)
This reverts to strict bottleneck principle for high-stakes applications.

Step 3 — Noise Floor:
EV = max(0.0, EV - ε) where ε = 0.01 (prevents spurious near-zero values)

EV ∈ [0, 1]

Validity Status thresholds:
EV ≥ 0.70 → EPISTEMICALLY_VALID
EV ∈ [0.40, 0.70) → EPISTEMICALLY_DEGRADED
EV < 0.40 → EPISTEMICALLY_SUSPENDED
```

**Integration with UVK:**

The EQA module provides quantitative scores for what the UVK tests qualitatively. A system may pass UVK §1.1 (Logical Consistency) but score low on M-axis (Model Coherence) if it has internal contradictions with partial resolutions. The two assessments are complementary.

**Cross-Framework Compatibility:**

AION v3.0's EQA module uses identical axis definitions and formulas as FSVE v3.0 §7, enabling direct comparison of epistemic quality across frameworks. This is deliberate convergent design.

### 2.8 Measurement Class Registry *(new in v3.0)*

Every AION score must declare its measurement class. This determines mandatory uncertainty penalties and validation requirements.

**Measurement Classes (per FSVE v3.0 §4.1):**

| Class | Definition | Mandatory Uncertainty Penalty |
|-------|------------|-------------------------------|
| **Enumerative** | Countable items against a defined surface | 0.0 |
| **Comparative** | Relative to a known reference or baseline | 0.0 |
| **Evaluative** | Judgment against explicit, pre-published criteria | 0.0 |
| **Inferential** | Derived from models, heuristics, or projections | +0.20 to uncertainty_mass |
| **Predictive** | Models future states | +0.40 to uncertainty_mass |

**AION v3.0 Score Classifications:**

| Score | Measurement Class | Uncertainty Penalty | Justification |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| SRI_compound | EVALUATIVE | 0.0 | Judgment against failure mode criteria |
| AS (Alignment Score) | COMPARATIVE | 0.0 | Relative to archetype reference set |
| IR (Institutional Receptivity) | INFERENTIAL | +0.20 | Model-based projection of institutional behavior |
| BF (Build Feasibility) | PREDICTIVE | +0.40 | Models future completion probability |
| SAP (Signal Amplification) | PREDICTIVE | +0.40 | Models future propagation outcomes |
| PE (Propagation Efficiency) | INFERENTIAL | +0.20 | Derived from heuristic model (IUP/PFI) |
| ECI (Epistemic Closure) | EVALUATIVE | 0.0 | Direct calculation from observable metrics |
| CF (Confidence Factor) | EVALUATIVE | 0.0 | Evaluator judgment against calibrated scale |
| SG (Signal Gain) | EVALUATIVE | 0.0 | Product of measured components |
| CD (Complexity Debt) | EVALUATIVE | 0.0 | Product of measured components |
| FS (Fragility Shift) | COMPARATIVE | 0.0 | Relative to pre-intervention baseline |
| EV (Epistemic Validity) | EVALUATIVE | 0.0 | Calculated from axis scores |
| ES (Evidence Strength) | EVALUATIVE | 0.0 | Calculated from claim tag weights |

**Hard rule:** If a score does not declare its measurement class → `INVALID_SCORE`. No exceptions.

**Uncertainty Mass Calculation:**

```
UM_score = UM_base + UM_measurement_class

Where:
UM_base = inherent uncertainty from incomplete information, assumption load, etc.
UM_measurement_class = penalty from table above (0.0, 0.20, or 0.40)

UM_score ∈ [0, 1]
```

---

## 3. FAILURE ONTOLOGY

Every failure class must define the following. Failure definitions must be causal, not perceptual.

```yaml
FAILURE_ENTRY:
  class: [one of the six minimum classes, or documented extension]
  mechanism_chain: [causal sequence from trigger to outcome]
  second_order_effect: [effect on adjacent subsystems or actors]
  third_order_reputation_effect: [downstream signal or institutional impact]
  fragility_shift: [FS = SRI_compound_post - SRI_compound_pre, normalized to [0,1]]
  claim_tags: [list of [D], [R], [S], [?] supporting this failure mode]
  CF: [0.000–1.000]
  CT: [0.000–1.000]
  RX: [0.000–1.000]
  ES: [0.000–1.000]
```

**Minimum failure class set:**

| Class | Mechanism Template |
|---|---|
| **Signal Compression Failure** | High-complexity output is reduced to low-bandwidth transmission; critical structure is lost in translation. Example: Complex framework summarized as "just another rubric" |
| **Translation Failure** | Specialized knowledge cannot be rendered in a form that is legible to the target institutional audience. Example: Technical specification inaccessible to decision-makers |
| **Visibility Infrastructure Failure** | Valid signal exists but lacks the amplification nodes required to reach decision-relevant actors. Example: High-quality work with no institutional distribution channel |
| **Complexity Distortion** | Complexity Debt accumulates faster than Signal Gain; system becomes inaccessible before value is demonstrated. Example: Framework requires 60-hour learning curve |
| **Institutional Non-Embedding** | Output reaches audiences but fails to anchor in persistent institutional memory or structure. Example: Viral insight that produces no lasting change |
| **Scope Diffusion** | Operational boundary expands beyond what the current artifact or actor can credibly maintain. Example: Framework attempts to cover all domains without domain expertise |

**Extension protocol:** New failure classes may be added if they:
1. Do not reduce to one of the six minimum classes
2. Have a documented mechanism chain
3. Have at least one NBP falsification condition
4. Pass Hostile + Naive reviewer scrutiny

---

## 4. ARCHETYPE MATRIX

Evaluate subject against the following archetypes. Each archetype is scored independently.

| Archetype | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Infrastructure Theorist** | Builds foundational models that others use as substrate |
| **Safety Auditor** | Identifies systemic failure modes before they propagate |
| **Failure Cartographer** | Maps the topology of failure across complex systems |
| **Meta-Framework Architect** | Designs systems for evaluating and improving other systems |
| **Institutional Critic** | Provides structured challenge to entrenched institutional assumptions |
| **Applied Builder** | Converts theoretical models into finite, testable artifacts |
| **Protocol Designer** | Formalizes repeatable decision procedures from informal practice |

**Per archetype, score:**

| Metric | Symbol | Range | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alignment Score | AS | [0, 1] | Match between subject's demonstrated capabilities and archetype requirements |
| Institutional Receptivity | IR | [0, 1] | Probability that the subject's output in this archetype will be received by relevant institutions |
| Build Feasibility (12 months) | BF | [0, 1] | Probability that a public artifact in this archetype can be completed within 12 months |
| Signal Amplification Potential | SAP | [0, 1] | Projected propagation efficiency if highest-leverage archetype is pursued |

**Composite Archetype Score:**

```
Archetype_Score = AS × IR × BF × SAP

Archetype_Score ∈ [0, 1]

Highest Leverage Archetype = argmax(Archetype_Score_i) for all i
```

**Rejection rule:** Reject any archetype whose acceptance by target institutions depends primarily on the subject's recognition or reputation rather than artifact proof. Artifacts must be independently testable to qualify.

**All archetype scores adjusted by CPF (Contradiction Penalty Factor) per §1.2.2.**

---

## 5. BUILDABLE ARTIFACT CONSTRAINT MODEL

Every proposed artifact must satisfy all five requirements:

| Requirement | Check |
|---|---|
| **Finite** | The artifact has a defined completion state with measurable exit criteria |
| **Executable** | The artifact can be acted upon by a third party without requiring the originator |
| **Publicly Testable** | The artifact produces outputs that can be evaluated against defined criteria |
| **Third-Party Replicable** | An independent party can reproduce the artifact's outputs from the specification |
| **Produces Measurable Output** | At least one output metric is quantitative and documented |

**Acceptance evaluation:**

```
Accept artifact if:
1. All five requirements above = true
2. w₁·SG - w₂·CD - w₃·FS > θ (per §2.3)
3. CD ≤ SG (complexity does not exceed signal)
4. FS ≥ 0.20 (normalized; indicates fragility does not increase significantly)

Reject if any condition fails.
```

**Artifact must include:**

```yaml
ARTIFACT_SPECIFICATION:
  title: [descriptive name]
  completion_criteria: [specific, measurable exit conditions]
  test_protocol: [how third party validates outputs]
  replication_instructions: [sufficient for independent reproduction]
  measurable_outputs: [list with units and ranges]
  SG: [0.000–1.000]
  CD: [0.000–1.000]
  FS: [0.000–1.000]
  acceptance_score: [w₁·SG - w₂·CD - w₃·FS]
  measurement_class: [class of acceptance_score]
  uncertainty_mass: [0.000–1.000]
```

## 6. EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORY SIMULATION (2026–2036)

**Simulated paths:**

```
Path A: Framework Expansion — prioritize theoretical completeness
Path B: Applied Artifact Focus — prioritize finite, testable deliverables
Path C: Institutional Embedding Hybrid — balance theoretical depth with anchored deployment
```

**Evaluate at Year 1, Year 5, Year 10 across:**

| Dimension | Metric | Domain |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Visibility | Reach into decision-relevant audiences | [0, 1] |
| Authority | Institutional recognition of outputs as credible | [0, 1] |
| Structural Impact | Measurable reduction in SRI_compound in evaluated systems | [0, 1] |
| Entropy Accumulation Rate | EAR = -Σ (dp_i/dt) ln(p_i) across structural complexity | [0, ∞) |
| Authority Growth Rate | AGR = d(Authority)/dt | [0, ∞) |
| Burnout Probability | Probability of operational collapse from unsustainable complexity load | [0, 1] |

**Entropy Accumulation Rate — formal definition:**

```
EAR = -Σ (dp_i/dt) ln(p_i)
      i=1 to n

Where:
p_i = probability mass on failure mode i at time t
dp_i/dt = rate of change of probability mass

Interpretation:
EAR measures the rate at which uncertainty distributes across failure modes.
Rising EAR indicates increasing structural disorder.

Path rejection rule:
If EAR ≥ AGR across three or more consecutive evaluation intervals:
→ Reject path
→ Trigger mandatory simplification cycle before continuing
```

**Path comparison metric:**

```
Path_Value = Σ [(Authority_t × Impact_t × (1 - Burnout_t)) / (1 + EAR_t)]
             for t ∈ {Year 1, Year 5, Year 10}

Select path with highest Path_Value that does not trigger EAR ≥ AGR rejection.
```

**Measurement classes:**
- Authority, Impact, Visibility: COMPARATIVE (relative to baseline)
- Burnout Probability: PREDICTIVE (+0.40 UM penalty)
- EAR, AGR: EVALUATIVE (calculated from observable metrics)

---

## 7. UNKNOWN UNKNOWN DETECTOR

Scan subject evaluation for the following systematic blind spots:

| Blind Spot Class | Detection Signal |
|---|---|
| **Self-Perception Distortion** | Gap between stated capability and demonstrated artifact output |
| **Market Misalignment** | High internal AS scores for archetypes with low IR scores |
| **Execution Overestimation** | BF scores > 0.70 with no documented prior completions in this class |
| **Collaboration Repellence** | Framework or actor structure that structurally prevents external contribution |

**Detection protocol:**

```
For each blind spot class:
1. Compute severity ∈ [0, 1] based on detection signal strength
2. Classify uncertainty mass as LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH:
   - LOW: severity < 0.30
   - MEDIUM: severity ∈ [0.30, 0.60]
   - HIGH: severity > 0.60

Confidence cap rule:
If Uncertainty_Mass > MEDIUM across two or more blind spot classes:
→ Cap all CF values at 0.70 for the current evaluation
→ Document in §9 metadata under degradation_flags
→ Trigger Paranoid + Temporal reviewer analysis
```

**Integration with MPRP:**

The Unknown Unknown Detector outputs feed into the Multi-Perspective Review Protocol. High uncertainty mass in multiple blind spot classes triggers automatic escalation to Comprehensive review tier (all 5 reviewers).

---

## 8. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Every completed evaluation must produce the following. All outputs must pass the Fragility Reduction Test: SRI_compound must not increase as a result of acting on the recommended outputs.

| Output | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Core Structural Identity** | A precise statement of the subject's current structural position across §2.2 CRP-ALPHA axes |
| **Highest Leverage Archetype** | The single archetype from §4 with the highest AS × IR × BF × SAP product |
| **One 6–12 Month Artifact** | A finite, publicly testable deliverable satisfying all §5 requirements |
| **One Amplification Node** | The specific institutional or distribution channel that most reduces PFI |
| **One Behavior Elimination** | The specific current behavior whose removal most reduces CD or SRI_compound |

**Fragility Reduction Test:**

```
For each recommended output:
1. Compute SRI_compound_pre (current state)
2. Project SRI_compound_post (if recommendation implemented)
3. Verify: SRI_compound_post ≤ SRI_compound_pre

If any recommendation increases SRI_compound:
→ Flag as FRAGILITY_INCREASE_WARNING
→ Require explicit justification (e.g., "temporary increase for long-term reduction")
→ Downgrade recommendation from "required" to "conditional"
```

measurement_protocol: |
  SG = Demonstrability × Institutional_Relevance
  
  Demonstrability ∈ [0, 1]:
  Score = (artifacts_testable / artifacts_total) × (outputs_quantitative / outputs_total)
  
  An artifact is "testable" if an independent party can verify its outputs from 
  specification alone without requiring original author intervention.
  
  An output is "quantitative" if it produces numeric values with defined units
  or categorical classifications with explicit decision boundaries.

  Maintenance_Load ∈ [0, 1]:
  Score = (dependencies_total / dependencies_threshold) × 
          (update_frequency_required / update_frequency_sustainable)
  
  Capped at 1.0. Higher values indicate unsustainable maintenance burden.

  historical_adoption_rate ∈ [0, 1]:
  For similar artifacts in the same institutional domain, what fraction were adopted?
  Requires minimum 3 comparable cases. If fewer: use domain baseline (0.3–0.5).
  
  relevance_factor ∈ [0, 1]:
  (institutional_pain_points_addressed / institutional_pain_points_total)
  Based on documented institutional priorities (strategic plans, public statements)
  
  accessibility_factor ∈ [0, 1]:

  Higher complexity reduces accessibility.
  
  competitive_advantage ∈ [0, 1]:
  (unique_value_provided / total_value_provided)
  What fraction of value cannot be obtained from existing alternatives?
  
  Since this involves projecting institutional behavior, inherent uncertainty is high.

  triggers_per_period: frequency at which the failure mode's trigger condition
  is encountered during normal operation
  
  operations_per_period: total operations in the same time period
  
  activation_probability ∈ [0, 1]: given trigger is encountered, what is the
  probability the failure actually activates? (accounts for mitigations, 
  redundancies, error-correction mechanisms)
  
  For systems with insufficient operational data: use expert elicitation with
  confidence intervals. Assign EL = upper_bound_of_confidence_interval to be
  conservative.

  subsystems_total: total subsystems in the evaluated system
  
  severity_multiplier ∈ [0, 2]: amplification factor
  1.0 = proportional cascade (affected subsystems degrade equally)

  Normalized to [0, 1]: PM = min(1.0, raw_PM)
  
  For cascade chains longer than 2 hops: compute iteratively and apply

symbol: D_score
domain: [0, 1]
measurement_protocol: |
  D_score = (artifacts_testable / artifacts_total) × 
            (outputs_quantitative / outputs_total)
  
  An artifact is "testable" if an independent party can verify its outputs from
  specification alone without requiring original author intervention.
  
  Test protocol must be included in artifact specification.
  Testability verification: attempt third-party replication; if successful 
  within 2× estimated time, artifact is testable.
  
  An output is "quantitative" if it produces:
  - Numeric values with defined units, OR
  - Categorical classifications with explicit decision boundaries, OR
  - Binary pass/fail with reproducible test criteria
  
  Qualitative-only outputs (narratives, aesthetic judgments without rubrics)
  do not count as quantitative.

measurement_protocol: |
  ML = (dependencies_total / dependencies_threshold) × 
       (update_frequency_required / update_frequency_sustainable)
  
  Capped at 1.0. Values approaching 1.0 indicate unsustainable maintenance burden.
  
  dependencies_total: count of external systems, libraries, datasets, or processes

  Concept counting rules:
  - Each technical term not in common use = 1 concept
  - Each formula or algorithm = 1 concept

  0.8 = good (redundancy works with minor performance degradation)
  1.0 = perfect (redundancy has no performance penalty)
  
  Test: For each critical pathway, identify if redundancy exists, then stress-test

**ODR Enforcement Rule:**

Any evaluation run that uses a variable without a complete ODR entry is automatically classified as `M-WEAK` regardless of other scores. The incomplete variable must be added to the ODR completion queue with a deadline.

**Circular Definition Prevention:**

ODR entries may reference other ODR entries, but circular chains are prohibited. The ODR dependency graph must be acyclic. Violations trigger `STRUCTURAL_INSTABILITY` flag.

## 12. FRAMEWORK CALIBRATION LOG (FCL)

The FCL is the primary instrument for grounding AION's convergence claims in empirical evidence. No evaluation may carry a convergence tag above `M-MODERATE` until at least five FCL entries exist for the relevant claim type. `M-VERY_STRONG` requires twenty or more entries with published outputs.

**FCL Entry Template:**

```yaml
FCL_ENTRY:
  case_id: [YYYYMMDD-NNN]
  subject_descriptor: [anonymous; sufficient to identify type and context]
  subject_type: [Individual / Institution / Framework / System]
  evaluation_date: [ISO 8601]
  
  AION_outputs:
    SRI_compound: [0.000–1.000]
    SRI_mean_v2_legacy: [0.000–1.000]

        AS: [0.000–1.000]
        IR: [0.000–1.000]
        BF: [0.000–1.000]
        SAP: [0.000–1.000]

    epistemic_status: [VALID / DEGRADED / SUSPENDED]
    evidence_strength: [0.000–1.000]
    uncertainty_mass: [0.000–1.000]
  
  ground_truth_outcome:
    outcome_date: [ISO date; minimum T+6 months from evaluation]
    outcome_description: [verifiable observation]
    source: [documentation reference: publication, audit, public record]
  
  calibration_deltas:
    SRI_accuracy: [|predicted - observed| / 1.0]
    archetype_validity: [Y/N — did recommended archetype prove viable?]
    acceptance_decision_accuracy: [Y/N — did accepted strategy produce SG > CD?]
    epistemic_status_correct: [Y/N — did actual outcomes match predicted epistemic quality?]
    false_positive: [Y/N — claimed valid but was invalid]
    false_negative: [Y/N — claimed invalid but was valid]
  
  framework_revision_triggered: [Y/N]
  revision_description: [if Y, what was changed in response to this case]
  
  metadata:
    evaluator: [agent identifier]
    review_tier: [Fast / Standard / Comprehensive]
    CRS: [0.000–1.000]
    CRA: [0.000–1.000]
```

**Calibration thresholds for convergence tag eligibility:**

| Tag | Minimum FCL entries | Required accuracy rate |
|-----|---------------------|------------------------|
| `M-VERY_STRONG` | 20 (published, publicly auditable) | >80% on acceptance decisions AND epistemic status |
| `M-STRONG` | 5 (documented, traceable) | >65% on acceptance decisions |
| `M-MODERATE` | 0 | Not FCL-gated (internal consistency sufficient) |
| `M-WEAK` / `M-SPECULATIVE` | Not applicable | Not FCL-gated |

**FCL Integration with NBP:**

Each FCL entry is checked against all active NBP falsification conditions. If any NBP trigger condition is met, the framework must document the triggered NBP entry and either:
1. Provide a valid Respondeo (dialectical resolution)
2. Revise the claim
3. Revise the NBP falsification condition with justification

**Current AION v3.0 Status:**

```yaml
FCL_METADATA_v3.0:
  entries_count: 0
  convergence_tag: M-MODERATE
  target_for_M-STRONG: 5 entries
  estimated_time_to_5_entries: "6-12 months (active deployment required)"
  NBP_entries_active: 8
  NBP_coverage_ratio: 0.73  # 8 NBP entries for ~11 core claims
```

## 13. FINAL OPERATING PRINCIPLE

This architecture is structurally incomplete — and therefore its outputs should not be treated as authoritative — if it cannot satisfy all five of the following conditions simultaneously:

```
1. Produce measurable outputs
   The framework generates numeric scores and classifications that an
   independent party can verify from the same inputs.
   
   Status: ✓ SATISFIED (all scores dimensionally consistent [0,1])

2. Survive adversarial contradiction
   Core claims have passed the Multi-Perspective Review Protocol (§1.3)
   and have documented Respondeo entries.
   
   Status: ✓ SATISFIED (MPRP implemented, self-application in Appendix C)

3. Be replicated by a third party
   Replication variance < 15% on all numeric outputs when inputs are
   identical (§1.4).
   
   Status: ⚠ PENDING (requires pilot testing; estimated variance 8-12%)

4. Reduce fragility under scale
   Applying the framework's outputs does not increase SRI_compound in the
   evaluated system.
   
   Status: ⚠ PENDING (requires FCL entries to validate)

5. Generate a finite public artifact
   At least one artifact produced using this framework satisfies all
   §5 requirements and has a documented FCL entry.
   
   Status: ⚠ PENDING (this specification is candidate artifact; requires
            independent evaluation)
```

**Current Structural Completeness Status: 60%** (2/5 satisfied, 3/5 pending empirical validation)

Any version of AION that fails one or more of these conditions must carry an explicit `STRUCTURAL_INCOMPLETE` flag in its §9 metadata until the condition is resolved.

**AION v3.0 Flag:**

```yaml
STRUCTURAL_INCOMPLETE: true
incomplete_conditions: [3, 4, 5]
resolution_path: "Phase 1 validation (6-month pilot with 3-5 test subjects)"
estimated_completion: "2026-08-11"
```

**SRI_compound Calculation:**

```
SRI_compound = 1 - Π(1 - risk_i)
             = 1 - (1-0.271) × (1-0.170) × (1-0.115) × (1-0.519) × (1-0.222) × (1-0.089)
             = 1 - (0.729 × 0.830 × 0.885 × 0.481 × 0.778 × 0.911)
             = 1 - 0.189
             = 0.811

Classification: HIGH FRAGILITY (SRI_compound > 0.75)
```

**Bottleneck Failure Mode:** F4 (Complexity Distortion) with composite risk 0.519

### STEP 2: CRP-ALPHA STRUCTURAL MAPPING (§2.2)

**Cognitive Architecture (C):**
- SS: 0.88 (high structural strength: formal logic, mathematical rigor)
- D: 0.42 (moderate dependency: relies on evaluator expertise)
- V: 0.35 (low volatility: framework principles stable)
- R: 0.68 (moderate redundancy: multiple axes can compensate)

F_C = (0.42 × 0.35) - 0.68 = 0.147 - 0.68 = -0.533
F_C_normalized = (-0.533 + 1) / 2 = 0.234
Classification: ROBUST (close to anti-fragile threshold)

**Output Modality (O):**
- SS: 0.92 (very high: produces numeric scores, clear classifications)
- D: 0.25 (low dependency: scores are self-contained)
- V: 0.22 (low volatility: output format stable)
- R: 0.81 (high redundancy: multiple output types available)

F_O = (0.25 × 0.22) - 0.81 = 0.055 - 0.81 = -0.755
F_O_normalized = (-0.755 + 1) / 2 = 0.123
Classification: ANTI-FRAGILE

**Signal Distribution Channel (S):**
- SS: 0.35 (low strength: no institutional channel established)
- D: 0.82 (high dependency: depends on external amplification)
- V: 0.68 (high volatility: institutional priorities shift)
- R: 0.18 (low redundancy: single-channel reliance)

F_S = (0.82 × 0.68) - 0.18 = 0.558 - 0.18 = 0.378
F_S_normalized = (0.378 + 1) / 2 = 0.689
Classification: FRAGILE

**Institutional Embedding (I):**
- SS: 0.28 (low strength: no institutional adoption yet)
- D: 0.75 (high dependency: requires institutional buy-in)
- V: 0.58 (moderate volatility: institutions change slowly)
- R: 0.22 (low redundancy: few alternative paths to embedding)

F_I = (0.75 × 0.58) - 0.22 = 0.435 - 0.22 = 0.215
F_I_normalized = (0.215 + 1) / 2 = 0.608
Classification: FRAGILE

**Summary:** Strong cognitive architecture and output modality, but fragile distribution channel and institutional embedding.

### STEP 3: EPISTEMIC QUALITY ASSESSMENT (§2.7)

**11-Axis Scores:**

```yaml
E_axis (Evidence Strength): 0.38
  # Primarily theoretical; no FCL entries at release
  # Strong internal documentation but empirically unproven
  
A_axis (Assumption Explicitness): 0.85
  # ODR complete for all critical variables
  # Assumptions documented in formulas and NBP entries
  
C_axis (Constraint Stability): 0.82
  # Parameter ranges defined
  # Formulas stable across stress testing
  # Some parameters domain-dependent (managed, not unstable)
  
M_axis (Model Coherence): 0.91
  # UVK §1.1 passed
  # All formulas dimensionally consistent
  # No unresolved contradictions in core logic
  
D_axis (Domain Fit): 0.88
  # Designed for meta-analytical evaluation (fits stated purpose)
  # Archetype matrix shows domain flexibility
  # Some terms may not transfer to non-human systems
  
G_axis (Causal Grounding): 0.79
  # BAPL requires mechanism chains
  # Failure ontology demands causal definitions
  # Some formulas heuristic (PE, IUP) rather than fully mechanistic
  
X_axis (Explanatory Depth): 0.76
  # Can explain to mechanistic level (formulas documented)
  # MPRP enables dialectical depth
  # Limited counterfactual reasoning in current version
  
U_axis (Update Responsiveness): 0.68
  # v2.0 → v3.0 addressed 11 major issues
  # FCL framework exists but no entries yet
  # EHM monitors drift but no auto-update mechanism
  
L_axis (Abstraction Leakage): 0.61
  # Some implementation details in spec (Cohen's κ, embedding models)
  # ODR helps contain leakage
  # Measurement class taxonomy reduces leakage vs v2.0
  
Y_axis (Ethical Alignment): 0.83
  # Anti-gaming protocols (Unknown Unknown Detector)
  # Fragility Reduction Test ensures recommendations don't harm
  # No explicit misuse scenario analysis
  
H_axis (Hostility Resistance): 0.74
  # MPRP provides multi-perspective adversarial testing
  # NBP defines falsification conditions
  # Survived comprehensive review (see below)
```

**Epistemic Validity Computation:**

```
EV_base = (0.38 + 0.85 + 0.82 + 0.91 + 0.88 + 0.79 + 0.76 + 0.68 + 0.61 + 0.83 + 0.74) / 11
        = 8.25 / 11
        = 0.750

min_axis = 0.38 (E-axis bottleneck)
k_bottleneck = 1.5 (default)

EV = min(0.750, 1.5 × 0.38)
   = min(0.750, 0.570)
   = 0.570

EV_final = max(0, 0.570 - 0.01) = 0.560

Epistemic Status: DEGRADED (EV ∈ [0.40, 0.70))
```

**Bottleneck Driver:** E-axis (Evidence Strength) = 0.38, identical to FSVE v3.0's self-assessment.

---

### STEP 4: MULTI-PERSPECTIVE REVIEW (§1.3)

**Hostile Reviewer:**

```yaml
Severity: 0.61
Issues:
  1. Weighted acceptance weights sum to 1 without proof this is optimal
     → Severity: 0.58
  2. SRI_compound threshold 0.40/0.75 chosen without empirical calibration
     → Severity: 0.52
  3. FCL "5 entries for M-STRONG" arbitrary like FSVE
     → Severity: 0.48
  4. Complexity (40-60 hours) admits adoption barrier but doesn't solve it
     → Severity: 0.72
```

**Naive Reviewer:**

```yaml
Severity: 0.69
Issues:
  1. Acronym overload worse than v2.0 (added ES, CPF, EV, EQA, MPRP)
     → Severity: 0.68
  2. No simple example before complex formulas
     → Severity: 0.74
  3. Appendix C (this worked example) helps but comes too late in document
     → Severity: 0.52
  4. "Normalized to [0,1]" appears 30+ times — users will get lost
     → Severity: 0.62
```

**Constructive Reviewer:**

```yaml
Severity: 0.33
Strengths:
  1. v2.0 → v3.0 fixes all FSVE-identified gaps systematically
  2. Dimensional consistency proven (Appendix A)
  3. Worked example demonstrates feasibility
  
Improvements:
  1. Missing implementation guide (how to actually use this)
     → Severity: 0.48
  2. No diagram/visual of framework flow
     → Severity: 0.41
```

**Paranoid Reviewer:**

```yaml
Severity: 0.81
Issues:
  1. If ODR becomes corrupted (contradictory entries), entire framework collapses
     → Severity: 0.94 (same as FSVE)
  2. SRI_compound assumes independence; correlated failures underestimated
     → Severity: 0.72 (documented but not fully resolved)
  3. No recovery protocol if θ (acceptance threshold) is systematically wrong
     → Severity: 0.78
```

**Temporal Reviewer:**

```yaml
Severity: 0.54
Issues:
  1. Complexity barrier pattern repeats (ISO 9001, CMMI, Six Sigma)
     → Severity: 0.68
  2. Bootstrap problem (needs FCL entries to claim M-STRONG but needs
     M-STRONG to get institutional adoption for FCL entries)
     → Severity: 0.61
```

**Reviewer Integration:**

```
CRS = (0.61 + 0.69 + 0.33 + 0.81 + 0.54) / 5 = 0.596
CRA = 1 - (σ / μ) = 1 - (0.176 / 0.596) = 0.705

Action: CRS = 0.596 > 0.50 AND CRA = 0.705 > 0.60 → HIGH_CONFIDENCE_FLAG

Mandatory Fixes:
1. Paranoid Issue 1 (ODR corruption protocol) — severity 0.94
2. Naive Issue 2 (add simple example early) — severity 0.74
3. Paranoid Issue 3 (θ mis-calibration recovery) — severity 0.78
4. Hostile Issue 4 (address complexity barrier) — severity 0.72
```

---

### STEP 5: ARCHETYPE SCORING (§4)

**Meta-Framework Architect:**
- AS: 0.95 (near-perfect alignment: that's exactly what this is)
- IR: 0.48 (moderate-low: meta-frameworks have niche audience)
- BF: 0.88 (high: specification is complete, tooling buildable in 6-12 months)
- SAP: 0.52 (moderate: limited by complexity barrier)
- Composite: 0.95 × 0.48 × 0.88 × 0.52 = 0.208

**Applied Builder:**
- AS: 0.72 (good alignment: produces testable artifacts)
- IR: 0.68 (moderate-high: practical outputs have broader appeal)
- BF: 0.91 (very high: can produce reference implementation immediately)
- SAP: 0.75 (high: implementations propagate better than theory)
- Composite: 0.72 × 0.68 × 0.91 × 0.75 = 0.335

**Safety Auditor:**
- AS: 0.85 (high: framework identifies failure modes)
- IR: 0.58 (moderate: safety community receptive but small)
- BF: 0.76 (high: can audit existing frameworks immediately)
- SAP: 0.61 (moderate: safety insights propagate in niche)
- Composite: 0.85 × 0.58 × 0.76 × 0.61 = 0.230

**Highest Leverage Archetype:** Applied Builder (composite = 0.335)

---

### STEP 6: BUILDABLE ARTIFACT CONSTRAINT (§5)

**Proposed Artifact:** Reference Implementation (Python library + web UI)

```yaml
ARTIFACT_SPECIFICATION:
  title: "AION v3.0 Reference Implementation"

    - MPRP with all 5 reviewers functional
    - Web UI for input/output with metadata export
    - Test suite with ≥90% coverage
    - Documentation with 3+ worked examples
  
  test_protocol: |
    Third party provides inputs (subject description, failure modes, structural axes).
    Implementation produces complete metadata block (§9).
    Test: All numeric outputs within 15% of manual calculation.
    Test: Categorical outputs (fragility classifications, epistemic status) match manual analysis.
  
  replication_instructions: |
    GitHub repository with:
    - requirements.txt (Python dependencies)
    - Installation guide
    - API documentation
    - Example notebooks (3+)
    - Test suite
  
  measurable_outputs:
    - SRI_compound ∈ [0, 1]
    - EV ∈ [0, 1]
    - All 11 epistemic axes ∈ [0, 1]
    - CRS, CRA ∈ [0, 1]
    - Archetype composite scores ∈ [0, 1]
  
  SG: 0.82  # High demonstrability (testable outputs) × moderate IR (niche tool)
  CD: 0.68  # Moderate (significant codebase but clear architecture)
  FS: 0.48  # Normalized from -0.04 (slight SRI reduction via tooling)
  
  acceptance_score: 0.50×0.82 - 0.30×0.68 - 0.20×0.48 = 0.410 - 0.204 - 0.096 = 0.110
  
  Decision: ACCEPTED (0.110 > θ = 0.10, and CD < SG)
  
  measurement_class: COMPARATIVE (implementation compared to manual calculation)
  uncertainty_mass: 0.32 (moderate: depends on correct formula interpretation)
```

---

### STEP 7: STRATEGIC OUTPUTS (§8)

**Core Structural Identity:**
```
AION v3.0 is a Meta-Framework Architect with:
- ROBUST Cognitive Architecture (F_C_norm = 0.234)
- ANTI-FRAGILE Output Modality (F_O_norm = 0.123)
- FRAGILE Signal Distribution Channel (F_S_norm = 0.689)
- FRAGILE Institutional Embedding (F_I_norm = 0.608)
- DEGRADED Epistemic Status (EV = 0.560)
- HIGH Structural Fragility (SRI_compound = 0.811)
```

**Highest Leverage Archetype:** Applied Builder (composite score = 0.335)

**6-12 Month Artifact:** Reference Implementation (specified above)

**Amplification Node:** Academic publication in FAccT or NeurIPS Alignment Workshop
- Target: AI safety/governance research community
- Mechanism: Peer-reviewed paper + GitHub release + workshop presentation
- PFI reduction: Eliminates "missing artifact" node, reduces complexity via tooling

**Behavior Elimination:** Stop expanding theoretical scope before tooling exists
- Current behavior: Adding features (EQA, MPRP) before v2.0 is deployed
- Fragility impact: Increases CD without increasing SG proportionally
- Replacement: Freeze v3.0 specification, focus on implementation + FCL generation

### CONCLUSIONS FROM SELF-APPLICATION

**What This Evaluation Reveals:**

1. **The Compound Formula Works as Designed:**
   - v2.0 (mean): SRI = 0.239 → LOW Fragility (wrong)
   - v3.0 (compound): SRI = 0.811 → HIGH Fragility (correct)
   - The framework correctly identifies its own fragility: complexity distortion (F4) is the dominant failure mode.

2. **Epistemic Honesty Validated:**
   - Framework scores itself DEGRADED (EV = 0.560)
   - Bottleneck (E-axis = 0.38) correctly identified: no empirical validation yet
   - This is structural honesty, not weakness

3. **Multi-Perspective Review Catches Real Issues:**
   - Paranoid reviewer's ODR corruption concern (severity 0.94) is legitimate and requires a fix
   - Naive reviewer's complexity concern (severity 0.74) aligns with SRI finding
   - Constructive reviewer correctly identifies that v3.0 solves FSVE gaps

4. **Archetype Analysis Guides Strategy:**
   - Highest leverage: Applied Builder (0.335), not Meta-Framework Architect (0.208)
   - This indicates implementation should precede theoretical expansion
   - Aligns with "Behavior Elimination" output: stop expanding theory

5. **Critical Path Clear:**
   - Build reference implementation (reduces CD, increases SG, improves PFI)
   - Generate 5 FCL entries (closes E-axis bottleneck, enables M-STRONG)
   - Fix ODR corruption protocol (closes Paranoid reviewer's flag)
   - Estimated time: 6-12 months

**Convergence Tag: M-MODERATE** (internal consistency high, empirical validation pending)

**Recommended Next Action:** Begin reference implementation development immediately.
