# AION-BRAIN Project Charter

## Project Name
AION-BRAIN

## Project Type
Independent, open research architecture for AI safety, validation, and confidence calibration.

## Purpose

AION-BRAIN exists to design, test, and document cognitive architectures that reduce unsafe behavior in AI systems through:
- Explicit uncertainty handling
- Domain-specific guardrails
- Reproducible validation
- Published failure analysis

This project prioritizes correctness, safety, and transparency over performance, scale, or commercial viability.

## Problem Statement

Modern AI systems:
- Express high-confidence outputs without calibrated uncertainty
- Lack domain-specific safety boundaries
- Do not publish negative or null results
- Conflate intelligence with reliability

These failures create systemic risk in high-stakes domains.

AION-BRAIN addresses these gaps at the architecture level, not the model level.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Cognitive engine design
- Validation protocols
- Safety benchmarking
- Failure documentation
- Human-in-the-loop oversight requirements
- Institutional and regulatory alignment mapping

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Autonomous agents
- Self-directed goal systems
- Claims of general intelligence
- Commercial deployment
- Replacement of licensed professionals
- Optimization for speed, profit, or market dominance

## Guiding Principles

1. **Safety Before Capability**  
   A system that cannot explain its limits is unsafe regardless of performance.

2. **Validation Over Claims**  
   Hypotheses are meaningless without reproducible testing.

3. **Failure Is Data**  
   Negative results are preserved, not hidden.

4. **Human Accountability Is Non-Optional**  
   No engine operates without defined oversight boundaries.

5. **Transparency Is a Design Constraint**  
   Black-box safety is treated as a contradiction.

## Success Criteria

The project is considered successful if it:
- Produces falsifiable, tested safety hypotheses
- Publishes validated failures alongside successes
- Enables third-party replication
- Influences safety practices without requiring adoption of the full system

Commercial success is not a success metric.

## Authority & Ownership

- The project is stewarded by its maintainer(s)
- Architectural invariants cannot be overridden by convenience
- Governance rules supersede individual preferences

## Amendment Policy

This charter may evolve, but:
- Purpose may not be inverted
- Safety may not be deprioritized
- Validation requirements may not be weakened

All amendments are versioned and justified.
