## Purpose

This document provides guidance on international data transfer mechanisms for users deploying AION-BRAIN-derived applications across borders. AION-BRAIN itself does NOT transfer personal data, but user applications may require data transfer compliance.

**FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE:** AION-BRAIN provides research frameworks only. If YOUR application processes personal data across borders, YOU are responsible for implementing appropriate transfer mechanisms.
