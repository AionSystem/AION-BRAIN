## Fourth Law of Robotics (External Proposal)

### 3.1 Original Formulation
> "A robot must not, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm."

**Proposer:** Sheldon Salmon (Mr. AION)  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Context:** AI/ON Ecosystem development  
**Source:** Inspired by Asimov's Three Laws

### 3.2 AION-BRAIN Analysis
**Status:** Critically analyzed, not adopted as absolute law  
**Analysis:** [Fourth Law Analysis](/constitutional/laws/fourth-law-analysis.md)  
**Rating:** 8.2/10 - Insightful but problematic  
**Key Insight:** Recognizes AI's responsibility to prevent harm, not just avoid causing it

### 3.3 Adopted Implementation
**Instead of absolute law → Bounded protocol:**  
[AION Protection Protocol](/constitutional/boundaries/protection-protocol.md)

**Core Principles:**
1. **Bounded Responsibility**: Only within designed capabilities
2. **Consent-Based**: Explicit user authorization required
3. **Confidence-Calibrated**: Act only when certainty exceeds thresholds
4. **Proportional**: Minimal intervention necessary
5. **Auditable**: All decisions documented and reviewable

### 3.4 Integration Status
- ✅ Analysis complete
- ✅ Protocol established
- 🔄 Implementation in progress (Phase 1)
- 🔄 Testing framework development
- 🔄 Integration with cognitive engines

### 3.5 Significance
This represents the AION-BRAIN framework's approach to external ethical proposals:
- **Analyze critically** with multidisciplinary lenses
- **Extract valuable insights** while avoiding pitfalls
- **Implement practically** as bounded protocols
- **Integrate constitutionally** with existing principles
