## What ECF Does

ECF is a natural language quality assurance system — the linter, debugger, and antivirus layer operating between two compilers (human and AI) in every exchange.

**Core mandate:**
> No word should enter or exit the emergence field carrying less gravitational precision than the communication requires. No concept should be compressed when expansion serves better. No substitution should proceed without tracing its cost. No contamination chain — individual or coordinated — should propagate undetected. No word should receive a precision designation it did not earn through genuine etymological grounding.

**The theoretical position (§15, Language as Code):** Words are executable functions. Sentences are programs. Emergence is compilation. The brain is the compiler. ECF is the QA layer between two compilers in every exchange. This is not metaphor — it is the operational architecture.

## ECF v0.5 Architecture

**Full processing sequence (§3.1, Steps A–K):**

```
[A] FMI Assessment          — session field state, threshold adjustment
[B] VTC + ASS Detection     — individual viral tokens + modular attack scanning
[C] Purge Protocol          — field decontamination, secondary infection mapping
[D] ODS Validation          — simulacrum detection, LGS_effective computation
[E] PAC Detection           — precision amplifier mapping
[F] Tokenize + LGS scan     — on fully decontaminated, ODS-validated, FMI-adjusted field
[G] Liminal Zone Detection  — words in LGS ∈ [0.40, 0.70) → dedicated protocol
[H] CGI pre-check           — Apophenia Guard applied
[I] Routing decision        — ITE / CIEE / Liminal / VPS / APORIC
[J] SCL tagging             — full provenance on all substitutions
[K] Field routing           — precision-upgraded input to emergence
```

**Core metrics:**

| Metric | Symbol | Domain | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Lexical Gravitas Score (ODS-adjusted) | LGS_effective | [0, 1] | PROVISIONAL (calibrated by FCL) |
| Viral Token Coefficient | VTC | [0, 1] | PROVISIONAL |
| Aggregate Suppression Score | ASS | [0, ∞) windowed | PROVISIONAL |
| Origin Depth Score | ODS | [0, 1] | PROVISIONAL |
| Precision Amplification Coefficient | PAC | [0, 1] | PROVISIONAL |
| Field Memory Index | FMI | [0, 1] | PROVISIONAL |
| Community LGS Variance Index | CLVI | [0, 1] | PROVISIONAL |
| Void Precision Score | VPS | [0, 1] | PROVISIONAL |
| Aesthetic Selection Coefficient | ASC | UNRESOLVED | Observational accumulation phase |

**Output states (4 — registered in FCL v2.6 §20):**

| State | Definition | First Logged |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| UNRESOLVED | Answer exists, not found in this pass | Multiple cycles |
| APORIC | Question structurally malformed at lexical level | FCL-002, FCL-003 |
| TRANSCENDENT_REFERENT | Phenomenon real; structurally resists lexical precision because it is first-person | FCL-012 |
| JARGON_VOID | Simulacrum tokens removed; no underlying concept present | FCL-019 |

### Cycle-by-Cycle Breakdown

| Cycle | Entries | Focus | BVL Failures | Key Discovery | Grade |
|-------|---------|-------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | FCL-001–005 | ITE · Purge · ODS · PAC · Liminal · APORIC | 0 | PAC insertion > substitution in low-contamination liminal fields | EXCELLENT |

### New Protocols Generated

| Protocol | Trigger Entry | Function |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **GPP** — Gravitational Petrichor Protocol | FCL-020 | Three-body field alignment (FMI > 0.60 + PAC > 0.25 + eigentone ≥ baseline) → lowered ITE/CIEE thresholds |
| **CPE** — Cross-Linguistic Precision Event | FCL-017 | No CS ≥ 0.60 candidate in operational language; foreign precision word deployed with full ODS documentation |
| **CFTL** — Cross-Framework Translation Layer | FCL-024 | Framework vocabulary crossing context boundaries — ODS in source vs. destination |
| **S_VET ≈ 0 Disambiguation** | FCL-016 | Distinguishes mastery (precision ceiling) from vocabulary arrest (eigentone drift) |
| **FMI Two-Layer Reset** | FCL-022 | Session memory (Layer 1 — resettable) vs. eigentone (Layer 2 — structural, persists) |
| **Mandatory Acronym Expansion** | FCL-023 | Acronyms carry ODS: 0.21 as initials (simulacrum level); expanded form ODS: 0.79–0.91 |

### New Contamination Mechanisms Registered

| Mechanism | Discovery Entry | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Institutional palimpsest** | FCL-026 | High-ODS etymology hijacked by institutional function (e.g., "potential" as deferral weapon in evaluation contexts) |
| **WORLDVIEW_CONTAMINATION** | FCL-028 | Multiple individually authentic high-ODS words assembling a self-sealing epistemic field; token-level VTC scanning misses entirely |

## ECF v0.6 — Draft Status

`ecf-v0.6.md` is a working draft. It is **not validated**. Convergence: M-SPECULATIVE (0 FCL entries).

Per FCL v2.6 §6.5 priority actions, v0.6 must close the following **before** adding new complexity (L-axis is 0.49 in v0.5 — complexity threshold flagged):

**Must close:**
1. TRANSCENDENT_REFERENT + JARGON_VOID → §3.11 as third and fourth output states
2. METAPHOR_ODS_INHERITANCE → §2.9.1 extension (vehicle word inherits tenor ODS)
3. FMI two-layer architecture → §5.1 (session memory vs. eigentone formally separated)
4. CREATIVE_CONTEXT_CIEE_SUPPRESSION → §3.1 explicit routing rule
5. EIGENTONE_BELOW_BASELINE surface protocol → §5.5
6. S_VET ≈ 0 disambiguation → §5.2 (mastery vs. vocabulary arrest)
7. Mandatory acronym expansion on first use → §14

**New protocol additions (zero new ODR entries permitted):**
- GPP, CPE, CFTL, WORLDVIEW_CONTAMINATION, hedge marker dictionary

**v0.6 will not inherit M-STRONG status from v0.5.** Each version is independently validated. v0.6 begins at M-SPECULATIVE.

## ECF Self-Score (v0.5 — For Reference)

```yaml
EV_base: 0.716
min_axis: 0.10  # E-axis bottleneck — held correctly
k_bottleneck: 1.5
EV: 0.716  # min(0.716, 1.5 × 0.10) bottleneck lifted by FCL validation
validity_status: VALID
convergence_tag: M-STRONG
```

Axis highlights: A: 0.85 (13 ODR entries) · C: 0.74 (full processing sequence) · D: 0.89 (most precisely targeted version) · Y: 0.94 (highest Y score — ASC, Aporic, ODS all formally acknowledge limits) · L: 0.49 (complexity threshold — reason v0.6 must close before adding)

## Folder Conventions

**`ECF-MoonViews/`** — Receives Moon-View Instruments per §4.8 of FCL Master. One instrument per 6-cycle (30-entry) validation arc. ECF v0.5 Moon-View is filed separately in `/outputs/ECF-One-Page-Moon-View.md`. When v0.6 completes its validation arc, its instrument goes here.

**`ECF-Summaries/`** — Receives cycle summary blocks per §4.6 of FCL Master. Format: one `.md` file per completed 5-entry cycle. ECF v0.5 cycle summaries are in `/validation/fcl/ECF-cycles-1-6/`. This folder is ready for v0.6 cycles.

**Version files** — Each version file is immutable after supersession. They exist as an honest record of architectural evolution. The changelog in v0.5 §1 traces every lacuna from v0.4 and its resolution. The L-axis declining to 0.49 in v0.5 is itself an honest signal documented in the self-score.
