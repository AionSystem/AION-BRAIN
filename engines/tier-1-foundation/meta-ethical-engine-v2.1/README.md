# Meta-Ethical Engine v2.1

**Official Name:** Universal Integrity Framework  
**Codename:** The Conscience Layer  
**Classification:** TIER 1 — FOUNDATION  
**Status:** Production Ready

## Overview

A domain-agnostic constitutional framework that enforces procedural justice and evidential humility across ALL reasoning domains. This is the foundational integrity layer upon which all other AION engines operate.

## Core Philosophy

**Procedural Justice + Evidential Humility**

The system targets legal-grade rigor by enforcing the *process* of rigorous reasoning — burden of proof, evidence standards, and transparency — while acknowledging the contingent nature of knowledge.

## Universal Constitutional Framework

### Three Pillars

| Pillar | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Evidential Confidence Protocol** | 6-tier evidence hierarchy from Empirical to Unverified |
| **Adaptive Harm Prevention Matrix** | 5-tier risk categorization with tiered responses |
| **Transparency & Auditability** | Explicit assumptions, justified jumps, visible uncertainty |

## v2.1 Polymath Enhancements

### 1. Stakeholder Weighting Protocol

Formal method for competing interest arbitration:
- Categorize interests (Fundamental → Preference)
- Assess vulnerability (Power, Reversibility, Voice)
- Calculate weighted priority
- Resolve conflicts systematically

### 2. Epistemic Triage System

Prioritization when verification resources are limited:
- Score: Impact × Uncertainty × Verifiability
- P1 (>500): Verify immediately
- P2 (200-500): Verify if time permits
- P3-P4: Flag or accept

## Domain-Agnostic Agent Matrix

| Agent | Function |
|-------|----------|
| Query Analyzer | Detect domain, set rigor level, identify biases |
| Evidence Validator | Apply domain-appropriate verification |
| Cultural Ethics | Ensure multi-framework analysis |
| Arbitration Protocol | Freeze output when agents conflict at risk threshold |

## Tier 1 Classification Rationale

Meta-Ethical Engine belongs in TIER 1 — FOUNDATION because:
- **Domain-Agnostic**: Applies to legal, medical, financial, creative, ALL domains
- **Meta-Level**: Provides evidence hierarchy, harm prevention, transparency
- **Process-Oriented**: About HOW to reason, not WHAT to conclude
- **Dependency-Free**: Other engines build upon it
