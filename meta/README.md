# Meta Documentation

This directory explains why AION-BRAIN exists and why it is structured this way.

Meta documentation captures design intent that cannot be inferred from code alone.

## Scope

This includes:
- Architectural philosophy
- Explicit non-goals
- Comparative positioning
- Historical research context
- Rejected alternatives and trade-offs

## Why This Matters

Without recorded intent, future contributors will optimize the system
toward convenience rather than correctness.

## Rule

If a design decision feels obvious, it still belongs here.
Obviousness fades faster than documentation.
