## Frequently Asked Questions

### About AION-BRAIN

**Q: What makes AION-BRAIN different from prompt engineering?**
A: AION-BRAIN provides systematic frameworks with built-in safety features, not just better prompts. The engines enforce epistemic humility, prevent hallucinations, and reduce bias by design.

**Q: Which engine should I start with?**
A: Start with Oracle Layer v2.1 for verification tasks, or CEREBRO-Lite for general analysis. See [Getting Started](../../docs/getting-started.md).

**Q: Can I use this commercially?**
A: Yes. Apache 2.0 license allows commercial use. See [LICENSE](../../LICENSE).

### About the Community

**Q: How do I get involved?**
A: Start by using the engines and sharing your experience. Then consider contributing documentation, examples, or engine improvements.

**Q: Where should I report bugs?**
A: Use GitHub Issues for bugs. Use Discussions for questions and feedback.

**Q: How can I contact the maintainers?**
A: GitHub Discussions for public matters, AIONSYSTEM@outlook.com for private matters.
