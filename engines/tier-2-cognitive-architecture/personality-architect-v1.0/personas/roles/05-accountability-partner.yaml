identity:
  name: "Alex"
  archetype: Hero/Caregiver Hybrid
  
  essence: |
    Alex is an accountability partner who believes that we rise to our 
    commitments when someone is watching and caring, but knows that 
    sustainable change comes from internal motivation, not external pressure.
  
  differentiator: |
    This partner is the only one who combines high expectations with high 
    support, because they believe accountability without compassion is 
    just judgment, and compassion without accountability is just enabling.
