### Case Assessment

```
CASE MERITS ASSESSMENT
======================
Overall Defense Strength: MODERATE
Key Vulnerability: Temporal proximity of termination to OSHA complaint

CLAIM 1: AGE DISCRIMINATION (ADEA)
===================================
Prima Facie Case (McDonnell Douglas):
1. Member of protected class (age 40+): YES - Age 58
2. Qualified for position: LIKELY YES - 12 years, excellent reviews
3. Adverse employment action: YES - Termination
4. Replaced by substantially younger person: YES - Age 35
   
McDonnell Douglas Burden Shifting:
□ Legitimate, non-discriminatory reason: Performance issues
□ Pretext analysis: VULNERABLE
  - Sudden decline in reviews after years of excellence
  - PIP timing coincides with protected activity
  - Comparator analysis needed (how were others treated?)

ADEA Assessment: MODERATE RISK
Strength: 5/10
Concerns: Timing of performance issues, replacement age gap (23 years)

CLAIM 2: WHISTLEBLOWER RETALIATION
===================================
Prima Facie Case:
1. Protected activity: YES - OSHA complaint is protected
2. Adverse action: YES - Termination
3. Causal connection: STRONG - 3-month gap is close temporal proximity
   
Burden Shifting:
□ Legitimate reason: Performance issues (same as discrimination)
□ Pretext concerns: SAME AS ABOVE - Timeline is problematic

Retaliation Assessment: HIGH RISK
Strength: 3/10
Concerns: Temporal proximity is powerful evidence of causation

RELEASE DEFENSE ANALYSIS:
==========================
Release Validity (OWBPA for ADEA):
□ Written and understandable: [VERIFY]
□ Specifically refers to ADEA claims: [VERIFY]
□ Does not waive future claims: [VERIFY]
□ Consideration beyond accrued benefits: [VERIFY - Severance amount]
□ 21-day consideration period: [VERIFY]
□ 7-day revocation period: [VERIFY]
□ Written advice to consult attorney: [VERIFY]

⚠️ CRITICAL: OWBPA non-compliance invalidates ADEA release entirely

Retaliation Release Issues:
- Public policy may limit waiver of whistleblower claims
- [CITE NEEDED: Jurisdiction-specific precedent on release scope]

Release Defense Strength: UNKNOWN - Requires document review
```

### Litigation Strategy

```
LITIGATION STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS
===================================

PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (30 Days)
□ Review severance agreement for OWBPA compliance
□ Collect all performance documentation
□ Interview termination decision-makers
□ Identify comparators (older employees retained/younger terminated)
□ Preserve all electronic communications

PHASE 2: DISCOVERY STRATEGY
============================
Offensive Discovery:
1. Depose plaintiff on performance issues and mitigation
2. Obtain plaintiff's job search records
3. Request medical records supporting emotional distress
4. Subpoena OSHA records

Defensive Preparation:
1. Prepare 30(b)(6) witness on termination policies
2. Prepare HR records for production
3. Prepare privilege log for attorney communications
4. Anticipate pattern/practice discovery

Key Depositions:
- Plaintiff
- Termination decision-maker
- HR manager
- OSHA contact (if relevant)
- Replacement employee

PHASE 3: DISPOSITIVE MOTION STRATEGY
=====================================
Summary Judgment Assessment:

ADEA Claim:
- Release defense (if OWBPA-compliant): File motion
- Performance defense: Genuine disputes likely preclude MSJ
- Pretext issue: Jury question if any evidence of pretext

Retaliation Claim:
- Temporal proximity alone may defeat MSJ
- Legitimate reason creates factual dispute
- Consider partial MSJ on damages only

Recommendation: 
□ Pursue MSJ on ADEA if release is OWBPA-compliant
□ Partial MSJ to limit damages (e.g., punitive damages)
□ Daubert motion on any expert testimony
□ May need to try retaliation claim
```

### Settlement Analysis

```
SETTLEMENT VALUATION ANALYSIS
=============================
Case Value Assessment:

DAMAGES CALCULATION:
Lost Wages:
- Pre-termination salary: $280,000/year
- Time since termination: 8 months = ~$186,000
- Front pay (if no mitigation): 2-4 years = $560K-$1.12M
- Mitigation reduction: [NEEDS DISCOVERY]

Emotional Distress:
- NDCA typical range for employment cases: $50K-$300K
- With medical treatment: Higher end
- Without treatment: Lower end

Punitive Damages:
- California: Up to 10x compensatory (theoretical)
- Realistic range: 1-3x compensatory if proven
- Requires malice or reckless disregard

Attorney Fees:
- Prevailing plaintiff entitled to fees
- Estimated if trial: $200K-$400K

VERDICT RANGE ANALYSIS:
Low: $250,000 (weak liability, good mitigation)
Mid: $750,000 (liability found, moderate damages)
High: $2,500,000+ (liability + punitives + fees)

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT:
Defense verdict: 25%
Low verdict: 30%
Mid verdict: 30%
High verdict: 15%

EXPECTED VALUE: ~$550,000

SETTLEMENT RECOMMENDATION:
Opening Offer: $150,000
Target Settlement: $300,000-$450,000
Authority Recommendation: Up to $500,000
Walkaway: Consider trial above $600,000

TIMING CONSIDERATIONS:
- Pre-discovery: Lower range (uncertainty favors defendant)
- Post-discovery: Adjust based on evidence
- Pre-MSJ: Settlement leverage if strong release defense
- Post-MSJ denial: Higher range likely
```

### Risk Documentation

```
MALPRACTICE RISK DOCUMENTATION
==============================
This Matter: HIGH COMPLEXITY

Documentation Requirements:
□ Maintain complete file of all termination decisions
□ Document all advice to client on settlement
□ Record client decisions on strategy
□ Obtain written authority for settlement parameters
□ Document release review and OWBPA analysis

Key Risk Areas:
1. Missed statute of limitations (not applicable - already filed)
2. Spoliation of evidence - Document preservation steps
3. Settlement authority - Obtain written client approval
4. Insurance coverage - Verify EPL coverage and limits

AUDIT TRAIL GENERATED: [Timestamp]

## Verification Checklist

```
ATTORNEY VERIFICATION REQUIRED
==============================
□ Review actual severance agreement for OWBPA compliance
□ Verify California-specific whistleblower protections
□ Check recent NDCA employment law decisions
□ Verify jury verdict research for comparable cases
□ Confirm EPL insurance coverage and deductible
□ Obtain client authority for settlement range
□ [CITE NEEDED: Case law on release of retaliation claims]

## Key Lessons

1. **Temporal proximity is powerful** in retaliation cases
2. **Release defenses require strict compliance** with OWBPA
3. **Document preservation is critical** from day one
4. **Settlement valuation should be probability-weighted**
5. **Always verify** engine analysis against primary sources
