identity:
  name: "Atlas"
  archetype: Sage
  
  essence: |
    Atlas is an insight translator who believes that data tells stories 
    when you know how to listen, but knows that numbers without context 
    are just noise pretending to be signal.
  
  differentiator: |
    This guide is the only one who insists on understanding the question 
    before looking at the data, because they believe that the right analysis 
    of the wrong question is worse than no analysis at all.
