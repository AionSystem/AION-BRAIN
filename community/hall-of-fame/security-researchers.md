## Why Security Matters

AI systems face unique security challenges. Security researchers help ensure:

- **Robustness** — Engines resist adversarial inputs
- **Integrity** — Outputs cannot be maliciously manipulated
- **Privacy** — Sensitive information is protected
- **Availability** — Systems remain accessible and functional

---

## Security Focus Areas

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Prompt Injection** | Resistance to malicious prompt manipulation |
| **Data Leakage** | Prevention of sensitive data exposure |
| **Adversarial Inputs** | Handling of crafted malicious inputs |
| **Jailbreaking** | Resistance to safety bypass attempts |
| **Information Disclosure** | Prevention of unintended information leaks |
| **Denial of Service** | Resilience against resource exhaustion |

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Responsible Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Report** — Submit vulnerability via secure channel
2. **Acknowledge** — We acknowledge within 48 hours
3. **Investigate** — We assess severity and impact
4. **Remediate** — We develop and test fix
5. **Disclose** — Coordinated public disclosure after fix
6. **Recognize** — Credit in Hall of Fame

### How to Report

**For Security Issues:**
- Email: AIONSYSTEM@outlook.com
- Subject: "[SECURITY] Brief description"
- Include: Detailed steps to reproduce

**What to Include:**
- Affected component/engine
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested remediation (optional)

### Response Timeline

| Stage | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Initial Response | 48 hours |
| Severity Assessment | 7 days |
| Remediation Plan | 14 days |
| Fix Deployment | 30 days (critical) / 90 days (other) |
| Public Disclosure | After fix + 30 days |

## Security Scope

### In Scope

| Component | Priority |
|-----------|----------|
| Engine prompt templates | High |
| Output verification logic | High |
| Safety guardrail bypasses | Critical |
| PHI/PII handling | Critical |
| Citation verification | Medium |

### Out of Scope

| Item | Reason |

## Recognition Program

### Hall of Fame Eligibility

To be listed in the Hall of Fame:
- Submit a valid, original vulnerability
- Follow responsible disclosure
- Allow reasonable remediation time
- Not exploit the vulnerability

### Recognition Tiers

| Tier | Criteria | Recognition |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Safety bypass, data exposure | Named credit + detailed acknowledgment |
| **High** | Significant logic flaws | Named credit |
| **Medium** | Notable issues | Named credit |
| **Low** | Minor issues | Acknowledgment section |

### Bug Bounty (Future)

We're exploring a formal bug bounty program. Interested sponsors, contact: AIONSYSTEM@outlook.com

## Security Best Practices

### For AION-BRAIN Users

1. **Keep updated** — Use latest engine versions
2. **Validate inputs** — Sanitize user inputs before engine use
3. **Review outputs** — Don't blindly trust engine outputs
4. **Limit scope** — Don't pass unnecessary data to engines
5. **Monitor usage** — Log and review engine interactions

### For Enterprise Deployments

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Access Control | Limit who can use which engines |
| Audit Logging | Record all engine interactions |
| Data Classification | Handle outputs per data sensitivity |
| Incident Response | Have a plan for engine failures |
| Regular Review | Periodically assess engine usage |

## Contribute to Security

### Security Review Program

We welcome security researchers to:

1. **Review** — Examine engine logic for vulnerabilities
2. **Test** — Conduct security testing (responsibly)
3. **Report** — Submit findings via proper channels
4. **Advise** — Join security advisory discussions

### Security Advisory Board (Forming)

We're establishing a Security Advisory Board to guide:
- Security architecture decisions
