```
We used AION-BRAIN cognitive engines (specifically [engine names]) 
to assist with [specific tasks, e.g., literature review, methodology 
validation]. All AI-generated content was reviewed and verified by the 
authors. The AI tools did not contribute to the original intellectual 
content of this work.
```
