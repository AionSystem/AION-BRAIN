## 4. Step-by-Step Guidance

### Step 1: Warning Signs

**Purpose:** Recognize the internal and external signs that a crisis may be developing.

**Exploration Questions:**
- "What thoughts do you have when you start feeling unsafe?"
- "What do you notice in your body when you're getting into a crisis?"
- "What situations or triggers make things worse for you?"
- "How do other people know when you're struggling?"

**Types of Warning Signs:**
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Thoughts | "Everyone would be better off without me" |
| Feelings | Hopelessness, emptiness, unbearable pain |
| Behaviors | Isolating, not sleeping, drinking more |
| Situations | Anniversaries, conflicts, financial stress |
| Physical | Sleep changes, not eating, physical pain |

### Step 2: Internal Coping Strategies

**Purpose:** Identify self-management techniques the client can use independently.

**Criteria for Effective Strategies:**
- Previously helpful for this client
- Accessible without others' help
- Realistic in a crisis moment
- Safe and healthy
- Can be done immediately

**Categories:**
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Physical | Walking, exercise, breathing exercises |
| Sensory | Hot shower, cold water, music |
| Cognitive | Journaling, reading, puzzles |
| Soothing | Favorite show, comfort food, pet |
| Spiritual | Prayer, meditation, nature |

**Professional Guidance:**
- Help client generate strategies that worked before
- Test strategies for accessibility in crisis
- Avoid vague items ("relax" → "take 5 deep breaths")
- Consider barriers and backup options

### Step 3: Social Contacts for Distraction

**Purpose:** Identify people and places that provide healthy distraction.

**Key Distinction:** These contacts are for distraction, NOT crisis support. The client may not discuss their struggles with these people.

**Professional Guidance:**
- Include mix of people and places
- Verify accessibility (available times, locations)
- Consider various contexts (work, home, evening)
- Ensure client has contact information readily available

### Step 4: People Who Can Help

**Purpose:** Identify people the client can openly ask for help.

**Criteria:**
- Client is comfortable disclosing to them
- Person is willing and able to help
- Person knows about client's situation
- Contact information is current

**Professional Guidance:**
- May include family, friends, sponsors, clergy
- Discuss what kind of help they can provide
- Consider having client practice asking for help
- Verify the contact has agreed to this role

### Step 5: Professionals and Agencies

**Purpose:** Identify professional resources for crisis support.

**Essential Components:**
- Treatment provider with contact information
- After-hours contact plan
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
- Crisis Text Line
- Local crisis resources
- Nearest emergency room

**Professional Guidance:**
- Ensure client knows how to reach provider after hours
- Program crisis numbers into client's phone
- Review when to use each resource
- Consider transportation to ER

### Step 6: Making Environment Safe

**Purpose:** Reduce access to lethal means during a crisis.

**⚠️ CRITICAL COMPONENT:**
Means restriction is one of the most effective suicide prevention strategies.

**Lethal Means Counseling:**
| Means | Safety Strategies |
|-------|-------------------|
| Firearms | Remove from home, gun safe with someone else's combination, trigger lock with key elsewhere |
| Medications | Limited quantities, locked cabinet, someone else dispenses |
| Sharps | Remove, lock, give to trusted person |
| Other | Location-specific strategies |

**Professional Guidance:**
- Be direct about discussing means
- Involve family/friends when appropriate
- Create specific, actionable plan
- Identify person to help with means restriction
- Follow up on implementation
