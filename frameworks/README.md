# AION-BRAIN Framework Directory

**Status**: 🚧 **Documentation In Progress** 🚧

This directory contains **32+ frameworks** spanning epistemic validation, domain-specific applications, and specialized analytical tools.

---

## 🎯 Core Frameworks (Fully Documented)

These four frameworks form the foundational validation infrastructure and are fully specified:

| Framework | Version | Documentation | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|
| **[FSVE](FSVE/)** | v3.0 | ✅ Complete | Foundational Scoring & Validation Engine - Epistemic validity assessment |
| **[AION](AION/)** | v3.0 | ✅ Complete | Structural Continuum Architecture - Failure-state extraction & fragility mapping |
| **[ASL](ASL/)** | v2.0 | ✅ Complete | Active Safeguard Layer - Runtime governance with graceful degradation |
| **[GENESIS](GENESIS/)** | v1.0 | ✅ Complete | Generative Engine for Novel Epistemic Systems - Pattern discovery & validation |

**Shared Discipline**: All frameworks enforce UVK (Unified Validation Kernel), ODR (Operational Definition Registry), NBP (Nullification Boundary Protocol), and FCL (Framework Calibration Log).

## 🔄 What's Happening

This frameworks directory is being systematically documented. Each framework will receive:

1. **Full specification document**
2. **Purpose and use cases**
3. **Integration with core frameworks**
4. **ODR entries** (operational definitions)
5. **NBP entries** (falsification conditions)
6. **Usage examples**

**Timeline**: Documentation being added incrementally as framework specifications are compiled.

## 🎯 How to Use This Directory (Right Now)

### **For Core Framework Users**
Start with the **4 fully documented frameworks**:
- **FSVE** for epistemic validation
- **AION** for structural integrity analysis
- **ASL** for runtime safeguards
- **GENESIS** for pattern discovery

These are production-ready with complete specifications.

### **For Other Frameworks**
If you need a framework from the additional listings:
1. Check the individual framework directory for any existing documentation
2. Contact `aionsystem@outlook.com` with subject `[Framework Request: NAME]`
3. Documentation priority will be based on user demand

---

## 📧 Framework Documentation Requests

If you need documentation for a specific framework urgently:

**Email**: `aionsystem@outlook.com`  
**Subject**: `[Framework Docs Request: FRAMEWORK-NAME]`  
**Include**: Your use case and timeline

Prioritization will be based on:
- Number of requests for that framework
- Urgency of use case
- Research vs. commercial application

---

## 🤝 Contributing

Know what one of these frameworks does? Have documentation to contribute?

1. Fork the repository
2. Add documentation following the core framework structure
3. Submit pull request with `[Framework Documentation]` label
4. Include sources for any claims made

**We will NOT accept**:
- Speculative descriptions without documentation
- AI-generated content without verification
- Claims about framework capabilities without evidence

**This is intentional**: We'd rather have incomplete documentation than false documentation.

---

## 📊 Repository Structure

Each framework, when documented, will follow this structure:

```
framework-name/
├── README.md                    # Overview and quick start
├── specification.md             # Full technical specification
├── ODR.md                      # Operational Definition Registry
├── NBP.md                      # Nullification Boundary Protocol
├── examples/                   # Usage examples
└── integrations/               # Connections to other frameworks
```

## ⚠️ Transparency Notice

**Why is this README incomplete?**

We follow the principle of **Structural Honesty First** (FSVE Principle 5): We admit what we don't know before claiming what we do.

Rather than generate plausible-sounding descriptions for frameworks without verified documentation, we explicitly mark this as work-in-progress.

This README will be updated incrementally as framework specifications are compiled and verified.

**Last Updated**: February 2026  
**Documentation Progress**: 4/32+ frameworks complete  
**Next Update**: As frameworks are documented

*For immediate needs, use the 4 core frameworks (FSVE, AION, ASL, GENESIS) which are fully specified and production-ready.*
