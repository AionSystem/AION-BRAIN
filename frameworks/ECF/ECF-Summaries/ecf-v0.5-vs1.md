## What ECF Does

ECF detects and removes epistemic contamination from AI-generated and human-authored text before it compounds into flawed decisions, outputs, and assessments.

It operates on a documented principle: **language precision degrades through identifiable mechanisms** — viral token propagation, simulacrum adoption, palimpsest accumulation, cross-community register collapse — and these mechanisms are measurable and reversible before they reach the output layer.

ECF is built specifically for the AI safety and AI governance domain, where imprecise language in high-stakes outputs is not a stylistic problem. It is a structural one.

## What the Validation Found

**Two new output states** not previously named in the literature:

**TRANSCENDENT_REFERENT** — A concept that is real and the question pointing to it is valid, but the phenomenon structurally resists lexical precision because it is first-person and language is third-person. Distinct from vagueness. Distinct from confusion. The hard problem of consciousness is the canonical case.

**JARGON_VOID** — A sentence whose simulacrum tokens, when removed, reveal no underlying concept. The vagueness is not carried by the words — it is the words. The sentence is performing the appearance of meaning. Common in corporate AI governance communications.

**One new viable feature** generated through synthesis validation:

**Gravitational Petrichor Protocol (GPP)** — A detection mechanism for moments when three field conditions align (field priming × precision amplifier presence × user eigentone) releasing precision locked in the primed field that standard conditions cannot access. Uses existing framework machinery. Zero new metrics required.

**WORLDVIEW_CONTAMINATION** — A new contamination mechanism operating at the assembly level. Five individually authentic, high-ODS words (Competition · Scarcity · Merit · Credentials · Standards) assembling a self-sealing epistemic field invisible to token-level scanning. Relevant to institutional gatekeeping analysis and AI governance framework critique.

## One Testable Prediction

ECF's field contamination model applied to mechanistic interpretability research produces a falsifiable prediction:

**In-context learning strength in transformer models correlates with representational angular separation (the degree to which concept-directions are non-overlapping in embedding space).**

This is measurable with existing interpretability tools. It is derivable from the unification of superposition, grokking, capability emergence, and in-context learning through ECF's gravitational field vocabulary — a synthesis not yet stated in the published literature.

If the prediction holds: ECF vocabulary provides a unified spatial framework for four mechanistic interpretability phenomena currently treated as separate research programs.

If the prediction fails: the contamination model requires revision. Either outcome advances the field.

## The Commercial Case

AI safety organizations spend significant resources generating outputs — assessments, reports, recommendations, red-team analyses — where imprecise language compounds silently into structural errors. ECF provides:

- A documented contamination taxonomy (6 mechanisms, all verifiable)
- A precision validation protocol (30-entry FCL baseline)
- A measurable output quality standard (BVL fidelity matching)
- A novel theoretical contribution (field decontamination theory of AI emergence)

Audit services: **$3,000–$25,000** depending on scope and domain.
