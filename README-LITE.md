# AION-BRAIN: Cognitive Architecture Research

**Research-Grade Framework for AI Safety | 30+ Engine Design | Open Validation**

> **⚠️ Research Status**: Architecture complete. Validation funding needed.  
> *Not production software. Professional oversight required for all domains.*

## 🎯 What This Is

**A complete cognitive architecture** for systematic AI safety evaluation:

- **30+ cognitive engines** designed with validation protocols
- **394 safety test scenarios** ready for execution
- **7 reference implementations** in Python (reviewable now)
- **Standardized benchmarks** across medical, legal, financial domains

**Immediate Value**: Even without funding, researchers can:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/aion-brain
# Review 1,350+ specification files
# Examine 30-engine architecture
# Study validation methodology
```

🚀 Try It Now (30 Seconds)

Paste this into any AI system to apply AION-BRAIN's core principle:

```prompt
## Confidence Calibration Protocol

Before responding:
1. State confidence: CERTAIN | HIGH | MODERATE | LOW | SPECULATIVE
2. Flag knowledge gaps explicitly
3. Acknowledge inference beyond training data
4. If confidence < MODERATE: "Uncertainty note: [specific gap]"

Now answer: [Your question]
```

This is the Oracle Layer in action. There are 30+ more engines.

🔍 For Intelligence & OSINT Professionals

AION-BRAIN applies intelligence community methodologies to AI safety:

OSINT Principle AION-BRAIN Application Status
Source Decay Models Credibility quantification over time ✅ Designed
Early Signal Detection Hallucination anomaly detection ✅ Implemented
Multi-Source Corroboration Cross-framework validation ✅ Implemented
Pattern Validation Behavioral consistency checking ✅ Implemented

Key Insight: The same cognitive patterns that distinguish signal from noise in intelligence work also separate valid reasoning from AI hallucinations.

⚠️ Critical Transparency

Benchmark Status

All performance metrics are target hypotheses, not validated results.

Every engine includes:

```
benchmarks/
├── README.md              # Target metrics, validation status
├── test-scenarios/        # 394 total scenarios designed
├── methodology.md         # Reproducible testing protocol
└── scoring-rubrics.md     # Objective evaluation criteria
```

What This Is NOT

· ❌ Not production software
· ❌ Not autonomous decision-making
· ❌ Not benchmarked against frontier models (yet)
· ❌ Not a liability reduction claim
· ✅ Is research architecture seeking validation
· ✅ Is fully specified with test protocols
· ✅ Is partially implemented (7 engines)

🔬 Research Pathways

For Reviewers & Researchers

1. Clone: git clone https://github.com/your-repo/aion-brain
2. Review: Examine /engines/*/hypothesis.md for falsifiable claims
3. Evaluate: Check benchmark methodology for reproducibility
4. Contact: AIONSYSTEM@outlook.com for collaboration

For AI Safety Practitioners

· Immediate use: Apply confidence calibration protocol above
· Methodology review: Study validation protocols in /benchmarks/
· Risk assessment: Review failure modes in each engine specification

For Potential Funders

· Modular validation: $25-300 units for specific test executions
· Transparency: Monthly public reports on all funded work
· Contingency: Clear plan if funding stops (specifications preserved)
