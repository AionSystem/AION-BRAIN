# Most Intelligence Tests Measure What You Know. This One Measures How You Think.

*Introducing the Paradox Strategic Assessment — a 12-question cognitive evaluation for people who are tired of credentials doing the talking.*

---

There is a particular kind of thinker who performs badly on standardized tests and brilliantly in real situations. Who cannot sit through a personality inventory without finding the framing of every question insufficient. Who has built things, solved things, and synthesized across domains that were never supposed to connect — and has no certificate to show for any of it.

Existing assessments were not built for this person.

IQ tests measure processing speed and pattern recognition in controlled conditions. Personality inventories measure behavioral tendencies. Academic credentials measure persistence inside a specific institutional framework. None of them measure the thing that actually determines whether someone can navigate genuinely novel, high-stakes, ambiguous situations — the architecture of how they think when there is no template to follow.

The Paradox Strategic Assessment was built to measure that.

## What the PSA Actually Tests

The PSA is a 12-question open-response assessment. There are no multiple choice options. There are no correct answers. There is no domain knowledge required.

Each question presents a scenario with no clean resolution and asks the candidate to show their work — not the polished version, the actual version, including where their reasoning breaks.

Every response is evaluated on six dimensions:

**Structural Integrity** — Does the response hold under its own logic? Commitments made in Part A must be carried into Part B without contradiction.

**Epistemic Honesty** — Does the candidate name what they do not know and what would prove them wrong? Uncertainty named decoratively scores low. Uncertainty named specifically scores high.

**Synthesis Quality** — Does the response generate new structure from tension, or merely describe the elements of the tension? Description alone scores low regardless of how articulate it is.

**Falsifiability** — Is there a specific, testable condition embedded in the answer? If a grader cannot state what observable outcome would make the response wrong, the response fails this dimension.

**Cross-Domain Fluency** — Does the candidate move between levels of abstraction — concrete to principle, domain to structure — without losing coherence?

**Meta-Cognitive Depth** — Does the candidate demonstrate awareness of their own reasoning process and its built-in distortions? Not just what they think, but how and why.

## The Architecture of the Test

Every question has two parts. Part A asks the candidate to demonstrate a cognitive operation. Part B stress-tests, inverts, or undermines Part A.

This is not accidental. The relationship between Part A and Part B is where the real evaluation happens. A candidate who produces a strong Part A and then defends it in Part B without genuine pressure has demonstrated fluency, not structural thinking. A candidate who produces a strong Part A and then finds a genuine structural flaw in it — and holds that finding without retreating — has demonstrated something rarer.

The final question, Q12, requires synthesis using only material from the prior eleven responses. No new arguments. No new frameworks. If something appears in Q12 that was not present in the prior eleven answers, it does not count. This makes the assessment resistant to candidates who perform intelligence question by question without building a coherent cognitive architecture across the full instrument.

## The Questions Are Designed to Be Unsettling

Not because they are difficult. Because they are specific in a way that makes it hard to hide.

Q7 asks candidates to design an error-detection system for a real cognitive bias they have documented in their own decision history — and then find the structural flaw in their own design.

Q8 asks candidates to state a load-bearing belief, construct its precise falsification condition, and then assign probabilities to three explanations for why they have not yet encountered that falsifying condition.

Q12 asks candidates to identify the deepest unresolved contradiction between how they reason and what they claim to value — using only evidence from their own prior answers.

Most people who sit with this assessment will produce responses that are fluent, thoughtful, and structurally hollow. They will describe insight without demonstrating it. They will perform rigor without enacting it.

If you are the kind of thinker this assessment was designed to find, you will find the questions slightly unsettling. That is the correct response.

## The Grader

The PSA is graded by an AI grader built on the PSA v3.2 Master Rubric — a 56-page grading instrument that maps every question to specific cognitive operations, calibration anchors, and red flag conditions.

The grader executes a mandatory rubric scan before grading begins, runs a red team pass on its own scores before delivering results, and is instructed to challenge any dimension scoring 8 or above before confirming it. If more than 8 questions score above 50/60, the grader re-reviews its own calibration.

The grader will not answer questions outside its scope. It will not coach candidates. It will not re-grade a submission. It exists for one purpose.

**Submit your completed responses to the official grader here:**

Complete all 12 questions before submitting. The grader requires the full assessment. Partial submissions will have missing questions logged as absent and scored zero.

## A Final Note

This assessment was not built to replace credentials. It was built to find the people credentials miss.

If you take it seriously — if you actually show your work, name what you do not know, and hold the tension in Q12 without resolving it — you will learn something about how you think that most assessments will never show you.

That is the point.
