# Module 3: Compliance Gap Analysis

**Engine:** Legal Engine 2 v1.5  
**Purpose:** Compare current state against legal requirements and identify gaps

---

## Overview

The Compliance Gap Analysis module systematically compares what the law requires against what the organization is currently doing, identifying specific discrepancies and rating their severity.

## CEREBRO Frameworks Activated

| Framework | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Meadows** (Systems) | How gaps ripple through compliance system |
| **Taleb** (Anti-fragility) | Which gaps create fragility? |
| **Pearl** (Causality) | Cause-effect of non-compliance |
| **Alexander** (Patterns) | Common compliance gap patterns |

## Gap Severity Matrix

### Severity Definitions

| Severity | Definition | Enforcement Risk | Example |
|----------|------------|------------------|---------|
| **CRITICAL** | Immediate legal exposure, active enforcement risk | Imminent | HIPAA breach, securities fraud, active wage claims |
| **HIGH** | Significant risk, near-term action needed | Likely | Missing required policies, worker misclassification |
| **MODERATE** | Compliance deficiency, medium-term risk | Possible | Incomplete documentation, training gaps |
| **LOW** | Best practice deviation, minimal risk | Unlikely | Suboptimal contract language, process improvements |

### Scoring Factors

```
SEVERITY CALCULATION:

ENFORCEMENT LIKELIHOOD:
├─ Active enforcement in industry? (+2)
├─ Regulatory focus area? (+2)
├─ Private right of action exists? (+1)
├─ Class action potential? (+2)
└─ Whistleblower incentives? (+1)

CONSEQUENCE MAGNITUDE:
├─ Criminal liability possible? (+3)
├─ Penalty >$100K possible? (+2)
├─ Business interruption risk? (+2)
├─ Reputational harm likely? (+1)
└─ License/permit at risk? (+2)

SCORING:
├─ 8+ points: CRITICAL
├─ 5-7 points: HIGH
├─ 3-4 points: MODERATE
└─ 0-2 points: LOW
