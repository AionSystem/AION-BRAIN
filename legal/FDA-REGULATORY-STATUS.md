## Regulatory Classification Analysis

### Why AION-BRAIN Is NOT a Medical Device

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(h)), a "device" is defined as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar article that is:

1. Recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopeia
2. Intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease
3. Intended to affect the structure or any function of the body

**AION-BRAIN Does NOT Meet These Criteria:**

| FDA Criterion | AION-BRAIN Status |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Intended for diagnosis | No — Research frameworks only |
| Intended for treatment | No — No therapeutic claims |
| Intended for mitigation | No — No disease intervention |
| Affects body structure/function | No — Documentation only |
| Manufacturer's intended use | Research and education |

## FDA Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Analysis

### FDA CDS Guidance Framework

The FDA's 2022 guidance on Clinical Decision Support Software identifies criteria for non-device CDS. AION-BRAIN meets ALL criteria for non-device status:

#### Four Prongs of Non-Device CDS

| Prong | Requirement | AION-BRAIN Status |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **1. Nature of Information** | Not intended to acquire, process, or analyze medical images or signals | ✓ Compliant — No image/signal processing |
| **2. Support, Not Replace** | Intended for HCP to independently review basis for recommendations | ✓ Compliant — Requires professional oversight |
| **3. Transparency** | Provides basis for recommendations so HCP can evaluate | ✓ Compliant — Open-source, transparent methodology |
| **4. Competence** | HCP not intended to rely primarily on recommendation | ✓ Compliant — Research framework only |

### AION-BRAIN's Non-Device Position

Class I (Non-exempt)              →    510(k) clearance
Class II                          →    510(k) clearance
Class II (De Novo)                →    De Novo classification request
Class III                         →    PMA approval
Clinical Decision Support (CDS)   →    Evaluate against CDS guidance
Non-Device                        →    No FDA submission (document basis)
