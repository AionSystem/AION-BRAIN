# Code of Conduct

## Our Foundation

AION-BRAIN is a published intellectual architecture—a cognitive framework for AI safety and epistemic validation developed by Sheldon K Salmon.

This Code of Conduct governs how individuals engage with this work, whether as observers, learners, critics, or invited collaborators.

**Core Principle**: Respectful engagement with ideas and rigorous intellectual discourse.

---

## What AION-BRAIN Represents

**This is**:
- A published body of intellectual work
- A demonstration of systematic methodology
- An externalized cognitive architecture
- A foundation for professional services

**This is not**:
- A community-driven project seeking consensus
- A democratic space where all voices have equal authority
- A collaborative work-in-progress expecting contributions from everyone

**Your role**: Observer, learner, applier, critic—not co-author (unless invited).

## Philosophy of This Code

**We believe**:
- Ideas should be criticized rigorously (intellectual honesty)
- People should be treated respectfully (basic decency)
- Authority should be clear (architect maintains final say)
- Boundaries should be explicit (no false collaboration expectations)
- Engagement should be voluntary (accept terms or don't engage)

**We reject**:
- Democratic governance of intellectual property
- Entitlement to contribute without invitation
- Consensus-seeking that dilutes coherence
- "Radical openness" that compromises quality
- Community pressure to change architectural decisions

**This is not**:
- Hostility to community (observers are welcome)
- Rejection of feedback (critique is valued)
- Authoritarianism (you're free to leave anytime)
- Closed-mindedness (we learn from engagement)

**This is**:
- Clarity about what AION-BRAIN is (sovereign architecture)
- Honesty about engagement model (observation + selective collaboration)
- Protection of intellectual coherence (business foundation)
- Respect for everyone's time (clear expectations prevent frustration)

---

## Questions About This Code

**"This seems strict. Why?"**

It's not strict—it's clear. You can do everything except commit code without invitation. That's one boundary.

**"What if I disagree with the policy?"**

You're free to:
- Not engage with AION-BRAIN
- Build your own methodology elsewhere
- Critique the policy publicly (ideas, not personal attacks)

You're not free to:
- Demand the policy change to suit you
- Violate it while engaging
- Claim it's "against open-source values" (this isn't traditional open-source)

**"How is this different from proprietary closed-source?"**

Proprietary: Can't see code, can't learn, can't apply  
AION-BRAIN: Full transparency, complete learning access, free application

**Difference**: You can see and learn everything. You just can't merge PRs without invitation.

**"Can I fork and change the code for my own use?"**

For learning: Yes  
For creating competing "AION-BRAIN Clone" business: Consult a lawyer

**"What counts as a Code of Conduct violation vs. just disagreement?"**

Disagreement: "I don't think Framework X handles edge case Y well because [evidence]." ✅  
Violation: "This architect is an idiot for not accepting my PR." ❌

Disagreement: "I believe this policy limits AION-BRAIN's potential impact." ✅  
Violation: "I'm going to keep submitting PRs until you accept them." ❌

**When in doubt**: Critique ideas, respect people and boundaries.
