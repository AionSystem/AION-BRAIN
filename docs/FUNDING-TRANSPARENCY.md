## Commitment
I will publish monthly reports showing exactly how sponsorship funds are used.

## Report Format
Each report will include:
1. **Income**: Total sponsorship received
2. **Expenses**: Detailed breakdown of costs
3. **Research Output**: What was accomplished
4. **Challenges**: What didn't work
5. **Next Month**: Planned research
