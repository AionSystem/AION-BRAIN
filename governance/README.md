# Governance

This directory defines how decisions are made within the AION-BRAIN project.

Governance is treated as a first-class system component, not an afterthought.
All rules here are designed to minimize ambiguity, prevent informal power
concentration, and preserve long-term research integrity.

## Scope

Governance covers:
- Admission and removal of engines
- Decision authority and escalation paths
- Conflict resolution and dispute handling
- Deprecation and freeze procedures
- Ethical boundaries around forks and reuse

## Design Principles

- Decisions must be explicit, documented, and reversible where possible
- No single individual has unilateral authority over core architecture
- Technical merit does not override safety or validation requirements
- Governance rules are versioned and auditable

## Non-Goals

- This is not a corporate board structure
- This is not a DAO or token-governed system
- This does not optimize for speed over correctness

All governance rules are enforced socially and procedurally, not by automation alone.
