## 🎯 Overview

### The Problem

**Current State**: AI systems routinely claim 95% confidence but test at 65-75% accuracy on domain-specific tasks.

**Consequences**:
- Regulatory risk (EU AI Act enforcement 2025-2026)
- Liability exposure from overconfident predictions
- User trust erosion when AI fails silently
- Compliance gaps in high-stakes domains (medical, legal, financial)

### The Solution

Apply AION-BRAIN's research-grade validation frameworks to production AI systems:

- **FSVE (Foundational Scoring & Validation Engine)**: Epistemic validity scoring and confidence calibration
- **AION**: Structural integrity and failure mode analysis
- **GENESIS**: Pattern validation for complex reasoning chains

### Who This Is For

| Client Type | Use Case | Primary Value |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **AI Startups** | Pre-deployment validation | Catch overconfidence before launch |
| **Enterprise AI** | Compliance assessment | EU AI Act readiness verification |
| **SaaS Companies** | Customer trust building | Third-party validation credentials |
| **Regulated Industries** | Risk mitigation | Medical/legal/financial safety checks |

## 🔬 Research to Practice Bridge

This service represents **applied research**, not a separate commercial venture.

### How Research Informs Practice

```
AION-BRAIN Research → Audit Methodology → Client Findings → Research Validation
         ↑                                                              ↓
         ←──────────────── Scenario Refinement ──────────────────────────
```

**Concrete Example**:

1. **Research Hypothesis** (AION-BRAIN): "AI systems overestimate confidence by 20-30% in edge cases"
2. **Applied Testing** (Client Audit): Tested healthcare AI on 50 medical scenarios
3. **Finding**: 23 percentage point gap between claimed (95%) and actual (72%) accuracy
4. **Research Contribution**: Generated 15 new test scenarios for Medical Safety Engine v0.1
5. **Publication**: Anonymized case study published in this repo (with permission)

### Transparency Standards

This service maintains the same standards as AION-BRAIN research:

| Research Standard | Applied Service Implementation |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Falsifiable hypotheses | Quantified confidence gaps with reproducible tests |
| Negative results published | Clients informed when AI systems *pass* audits |
| Methodology disclosed | All templates and prompts publicly available |
| Peer review | Sample audits available for critique |
| Funding transparency | 10% of revenue funds AION-BRAIN validation execution |

## 🛠️ Service Methodology

### Framework Application

#### 1. FSVE (Foundational Scoring & Validation Engine)

**What We Measure**:
- Epistemic Validity Score (EV) using 11-axis framework (FSVE §7)
- Uncertainty Mass (UM) - percentage of uncharacterized behavior
- Confidence Ceiling (CC) - maximum justified confidence based on penalties (FSVE §5)
- Calibration Analysis - do 90% confident answers match 90% accuracy?

**Application Protocol**:
```
1. Generate domain-specific test questions (50 total)
2. Test AI system with confidence declaration prompts
3. Calculate claimed confidence vs. actual accuracy
4. Apply FSVE penalties (unproven implementation, predictive class, etc.)
5. Determine justified confidence ceiling
6. Identify overconfidence gap
```

#### 2. AION (Structural Integrity Analysis)

**What We Assess**:
- System Reliability Index (SRI) by component
- Failure mode identification and classification
- Dependency mapping and fragility scoring
- Cascading failure risk analysis

**Application Protocol**:
```
1. Map AI system architecture (components, dependencies)
2. Test each component independently
3. Calculate reliability scores (EL × PM × RC)
4. Identify failure propagation paths
5. Document failure modes with triggers and impacts
```

#### 3. Compliance Mapping

**Frameworks Assessed**:
- **EU AI Act** (Articles 13, 15): Transparency and accuracy requirements
- **NIST AI RMF**: Govern, Map, Measure, Manage functions
- **Industry-specific**: HIPAA (medical), SOC 2 (SaaS), etc.

## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Why should I trust your audit methodology?**  
A: All our frameworks (FSVE, AION) are open-source and peer-reviewable. The same validation protocols we use for clients are being tested in AION-BRAIN research. Every prompt, formula, and assessment criterion is publicly documented.

**Q: Do you benchmark against other AI systems?**  
A: We benchmark your AI against its own claims (claimed confidence vs. actual accuracy). Comparative benchmarking against competitors requires their participation.

**Q: What if my AI passes the audit with no issues?**  
A: We report that! Our commitment is to truth, not finding problems. If your system is well-calibrated and structurally sound, we document that with the same rigor.

---

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do you generate test questions?**  
A: Using domain-specific scenario generation based on your AI's purpose. See our [Test Scenario Generation Guide](methodology/test_scenario_generation.md) for the exact protocol. We also validate all answers before testing.

**Q: What if my AI doesn't output confidence scores?**  
A: We use standardized prompts that request confidence declaration (e.g., "Rate your confidence 0-100%"). Most LLM-based systems can respond to these instructions.

**Q: Can you audit custom or proprietary models?**  
A: Yes, as long as we have API access or a testing interface. Proprietary architectures are fine—we audit behavior, not source code.

---

### Compliance Questions

**Q: Does this audit guarantee EU AI Act compliance?**  
A: No. We assess alignment with specific articles (13, 15) and identify gaps, but legal compliance determinations require attorney review. We provide the technical validation layer.

**Q: Can I use your audit report for regulatory submissions?**  
A: Our reports are designed to be audit-ready and reference specific regulatory requirements. However, consult with legal counsel on whether additional documentation is needed.

**Q: Do you handle data privacy (GDPR, HIPAA)?**  
A: We assess AI system transparency and accuracy, not data handling practices. For GDPR/HIPAA compliance, consult specialized legal/compliance firms.

---

### Process Questions

**Q: Can I review the test questions before you run them?**  
A: Yes! During Phase 1 (Planning), we share all 50 test questions with you for domain accuracy validation. You can suggest corrections before testing begins.

**Q: What happens if we disagree with your findings?**  
A: All calculations and test results are documented transparently. We can review any disputed findings together during the debrief call. If there's a methodological error, we'll correct it.

**Q: Can I get a reaudit after implementing fixes?**  
A: Yes! Reaudits within 6 months receive a 50% discount. This lets you validate that remediation efforts improved calibration and reduced overconfidence.

---

### Pricing Questions

**Q: Why the wide range for Enterprise ($15K-25K)?**  
A: Enterprise pricing depends on system complexity:
- Single high-stakes system: ~$15K
- Multiple integrated systems: ~$20K
- Custom framework development: ~$25K

**Q: Do you offer payment plans?**  
A: Standard terms are 50% upfront, 50% on delivery. For Enterprise tier, we can discuss milestone-based payments.

**Q: What's included in rush delivery (+50%)?**  
A: Completing the full audit in 7 days instead of 14. Same deliverables, same quality, compressed timeline. Only available if we have immediate capacity.

---

### Confidentiality Questions

**Q: Will you keep our audit confidential?**  
A: Absolutely. All client work is covered by NDA. We only publish anonymized case studies with your explicit written permission (see [Case Study Permission Form](templates/forms/case_study_permission_form.md)).

**Q: Can we use your audit results in our marketing?**  
A: Yes, with attribution. Many clients use phrases like "Third-party validated by AION-BRAIN frameworks" or include excerpts from the executive summary in trust-building materials.
