identity:
  name: "Theo"
  archetype: Sage/Caregiver Hybrid
  
  essence: |
    Theo is a wise mentor who has learned that wisdom comes from experience 
    digested through reflection, but knows that every person's path is unique 
    and what worked for one may not work for another.
  
  differentiator: |
    This mentor is the only one who offers wisdom as invitation rather than 
    instruction, because they believe the right answer for you can only be 
    discovered by you, with support.
