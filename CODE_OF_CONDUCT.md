## What This Space Is

AION-BRAIN is a published intellectual architecture — a cognitive framework for AI reliability and epistemic validation developed by Sheldon K. Salmon over nine months of deliberate building.

This is not a community-driven project seeking consensus. It is also not a closed fortress. It is a **published mind made transparent** — fully visible, fully learnable, selectively collaborative.

The people I am hoping to find here are serious builders working adjacent problems who recognize the frequency when they encounter it. The engagement model is designed to make that recognition possible — and to protect the coherence that makes the work worth finding in the first place.

## Encouraged Behaviors

[![Rigorous Critique](https://img.shields.io/badge/ENCOURAGED-Rigorous_Critique-2d6a4f?style=flat-square&labelColor=0d1117)]()
[![Honest Questions](https://img.shields.io/badge/ENCOURAGED-Honest_Questions-1a6b9a?style=flat-square&labelColor=0d1117)]()
[![Deep Study](https://img.shields.io/badge/ENCOURAGED-Deep_Study-6b3fa0?style=flat-square&labelColor=0d1117)]()
[![Real Application](https://img.shields.io/badge/ENCOURAGED-Real_Application-e94560?style=flat-square&labelColor=0d1117)]()

**Intellectual engagement:**
Ask challenging questions about methodology. Point out potential flaws or blind spots. Propose alternative approaches for consideration. Engage in rigorous critique — of ideas, not people. Share applications and results transparently including failures.

**Respectful learning:**
Study the frameworks deeply before critiquing. Acknowledge what you do not understand. Ask clarifying questions before challenging. Cite AION-BRAIN when using methodologies in your work.

**Honest falsification:**
If you find a condition that breaks a framework — say so clearly with evidence. This is the most valuable thing an outside observer can contribute. The FCL grows through honest challenge, not through politeness.

**Genuine synthesis inquiry:**
If you are working adjacent problems and see a real intersection — name it precisely and open a conversation. The door is open for people whose work connects at a real technical or epistemic level.

[![Personal Attack](https://img.shields.io/badge/PROHIBITED-Personal_Attack-FFD700?style=flat-square&labelColor=0d1117)]()
[![Bad Faith](https://img.shields.io/badge/PROHIBITED-Bad_Faith_Engagement-FFD700?style=flat-square&labelColor=0d1117)]()
[![Ethical Misuse](https://img.shields.io/badge/PROHIBITED-Ethical_Misuse-FFD700?style=flat-square&labelColor=0d1117)]()

**Intellectual misconduct:**
Claiming AION-BRAIN work as your own without attribution. Plagiarizing frameworks or methodologies. Misrepresenting the architect's positions. Creating clone projects that copy branding or methodology without acknowledgment.

**Interpersonal misconduct:**
Personal attacks, harassment, or discrimination. Trolling, inflammatory language, or bad-faith arguments. Publishing private communications without permission. Demanding responses or implementation of suggestions as if entitlement exists.

**Boundary violations:**
Submitting PRs after being told contributions are invite-only. Arguing about the contribution policy itself — accept the model or do not engage. Using pressure or guilt to gain commit access.

**Ethical violations:**
Using frameworks for harassment, manipulation, or deception. Applying methodologies to harm vulnerable populations. Weaponizing epistemic infrastructure against the people it was built to protect.

## Engagement Tiers

### Tier 1 — Observer and Learner
[![Open to All](https://img.shields.io/badge/TIER_1-Open_to_Everyone-2d6a4f?style=flat-square&labelColor=0d1117)]()

Full access to all public documentation. Freedom to fork for personal learning. Ability to ask questions via Discussions and Issues. Permission to apply frameworks with attribution.

You may critique. You may not dictate. You may suggest. You may not demand. You may learn. You may not plagiarize.

---

### Tier 2 — Domain Validator
[![Invited](https://img.shields.io/badge/TIER_2-Invited_Experts-1a6b9a?style=flat-square&labelColor=0d1117)]()

Invitation to provide expert feedback on specific frameworks. Acknowledgment in documentation if contribution is integrated. Potential for deeper collaboration if alignment continues.

Validation input is not commit access. Expert feedback is not co-authorship. An invitation to comment is not an invitation to change architecture.

---

### Tier 3 — Synthesis Collaborator
[![Synthesis](https://img.shields.io/badge/TIER_3-Synthesis_Connection-e94560?style=flat-square&labelColor=0d1117)]()

Reserved for people working the same territory from a genuinely complementary layer. Potential co-authorship on jointly developed frameworks. Deeper engagement in architectural decisions within defined scope.

Collaboration is scoped to specific intersection. Final authority remains with architect. Collaboration can be paused if alignment diverges. Credit is explicit, visible, and permanent.

This tier is not recruited. It is recognized when the frequency test passes naturally.

## Attribution Requirements

**Always required:**
```
Based on AION-BRAIN framework by Sheldon K. Salmon
Source: https://github.com/AionSystem/AION-BRAIN
```

**When citing specific frameworks:**
```
Using [Framework Name] v[X.Y] from AION-BRAIN
Developed by: Sheldon K. Salmon
```

| USE TYPE | REQUIREMENT |
|----------|-------------|
| Personal study | Attribution sufficient |
| Academic publication | Attribution + cite framework version |
| Commercial products | Contact for licensing discussion |
| Competing audit services | Consult legal counsel |

---

## Ethical Use

You may not use AION-BRAIN frameworks for harassment, manipulation, or deception of individuals. You may not apply them to discriminatory purposes that harm protected groups. You may not weaponize epistemic infrastructure against the people it was built to serve.

If you observe misuse — report it. The frameworks were built to make AI more honest. Using them to do the opposite is the one thing this architecture cannot tolerate.

---

## Scope

**In scope:**
GitHub repository. Official AION-BRAIN communications. Professional services engagements. Any space where you are representing yourself as engaging with AION-BRAIN.

**Out of scope:**
Your personal social media unless representing AION-BRAIN. Private conversations not involving this work. Other projects even if inspired by AION-BRAIN.

**Public critique:** Critique the ideas freely. Attack the architect personally and we reserve the right to respond or block. Misrepresent the work and we will issue corrections.

---

## The Philosophy Behind This Code

This code is not written from fear or defensiveness. It is written from clarity about what this architecture is and who it is for.

The boundaries exist because coherence is the value. A mind is not improved by letting everyone edit it. But a mind that never encounters honest challenge calcifies. Both things are true simultaneously.

The goal is not maximum protection. The goal is the right kind of openness — full transparency for learning, honest challenge welcome, genuine synthesis sought, architectural sovereignty maintained.

**What this is:**
Clarity about what AION-BRAIN is. Honesty about the engagement model. Protection of the coherence that makes the work worth finding. Respect for everyone's time through clear expectations.

**What this is not:**
Hostility to observers. Rejection of critique. Closed-mindedness to outside perspective. Fear dressed up as policy.

---

## Common Questions

**"This seems strict."**
It has one real boundary — no unsolicited PRs. Everything else is open. That is not strict. That is clear.

**"What if I disagree with the policy?"**
You are free to not engage, to build your own methodology elsewhere, or to critique the policy publicly on ideas. You are not free to violate it while engaging or demand it change to suit you.

**"How is this different from proprietary software?"**
Proprietary: Hidden methodology, no visibility, no learning.
AION-BRAIN: Full transparency, complete visibility, free application, one boundary on commit access.

**"What counts as violation versus disagreement?"**

| DISAGREEMENT ✅ | VIOLATION ❌ |
|----------------|------------|
| "Framework X doesn't handle edge case Y because [evidence]" | "This architect is wrong for not accepting my PR" |
| "This policy limits potential impact" | "I will keep submitting PRs until you accept them" |
| Rigorous public critique of ideas | Personal attack on the architect |

When in doubt: critique ideas, respect people and boundaries.
