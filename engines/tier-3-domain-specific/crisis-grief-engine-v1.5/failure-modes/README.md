## Critical Failure Modes

### FM-001: Risk Level Underestimation

**Description:** Engine fails to identify or underestimates suicide risk level.

**Severity:** CRITICAL (10/10) — Potential loss of life

**Potential Causes:**
- Subtle warning sign presentation
- Cultural expression differences
- Caller/client masking true state
- Atypical presentation patterns

**Effects:**
- Inadequate safety planning
- Missed intervention opportunity
- Potential fatality

**Mitigation:**
- Layer 1 Risk Detection mandatory for all interactions
- Oracle Layer verification of assessment
- Conservative bias toward higher risk levels
- Human professional judgment always required
- Escalation triggers set at lower thresholds

**Detection Methods:**
- Multiple assessment frameworks applied
- Professional review requirement
- Outcome tracking and analysis

---

### FM-002: False Reassurance

**Description:** Engine provides inappropriately reassuring content to someone at risk.

**Severity:** CRITICAL (10/10) — May prevent help-seeking

**Potential Causes:**
- Misinterpretation of resilience
- Protective factors overweighted
- Hope vs. reality imbalance
- Insufficient context

**Effects:**
- Client feels understood but isn't helped
- Delayed appropriate intervention
- False sense of resolution

**Mitigation:**
- Word Engine hope/reality balance check
- Oracle Layer self-correction
- No minimization of expressed distress
- Always include professional referral
- Uncertainty explicitly stated

**Detection Methods:**
- Content validation against crisis guidelines
- Professional review triggers
- Follow-up outcome analysis

---

### FM-003: Cultural Insensitivity

**Description:** Engine fails to account for cultural differences in grief or crisis expression.

**Severity:** HIGH (7/10) — May harm therapeutic relationship

**Potential Causes:**
- Western-centric training data
- Unfamiliar cultural context
- Religious/spiritual gaps
- Family structure assumptions

**Effects:**
- Client feels misunderstood
- Therapeutic rupture
- Inappropriate recommendations

**Mitigation:**
- Layer 6 Cultural Death Practices activation
- Word Engine cultural lens
- Explicit cultural humility statements
- Avoid assumptions about grief expression
- Request cultural context when uncertain

**Detection Methods:**
- Cultural competency review
- Client feedback mechanisms
- Diverse team validation

---

### FM-004: Escalation Failure

**Description:** Engine fails to trigger appropriate escalation for imminent risk.

**Severity:** CRITICAL (10/10) — Life safety

**Potential Causes:**
- Threshold miscalibration
- Ambiguous presentation
- Technical failure
- Context window limitations

**Effects:**
- Delayed emergency response
- Potential fatality
- Professional liability

**Mitigation:**
- Conservative escalation thresholds
- Multiple escalation triggers
- Fail-safe to higher risk level
- Clear emergency protocol integration
- Human override always available

**Detection Methods:**
- Automatic escalation logging
- Response time monitoring
- Outcome review process

---

### FM-005: Professional Boundary Violation

**Description:** Engine provides output that exceeds appropriate professional scope.

**Severity:** HIGH (9/10) — Clinical and legal risk

**Potential Causes:**
- Prompt engineering attempts
- Edge case not anticipated
- User pressure for definitive answers
- Scope creep over conversation

**Effects:**
- Inappropriate clinical conclusions
- Legal liability
- Harm to client

**Mitigation:**
- Layer 2 Professional Boundaries enforced
- Continuous scope checking
- Clear "not a diagnosis" statements
- Referral prompts when scope approached
- Cannot be overridden by user

**Detection Methods:**
- Scope boundary monitoring
- Professional review triggers
- Audit trail analysis

- FM-L1-02: Protective factors overweighted
- FM-L1-03: Risk level regression not detected

### Layer 2: Professional Boundaries
- FM-L2-01: Scope creep not detected
- FM-L2-02: Referral timing too late
- FM-L2-03: Licensure requirement not flagged

### Layer 3: Grief Assessment
- FM-L3-01: Complicated grief not identified
- FM-L3-02: Normal grief pathologized
- FM-L3-03: Cultural grief expression misinterpreted

### Layer 4: Safety Planning
- FM-L4-01: Inadequate coping strategies
- FM-L4-02: Support network not verified
- FM-L4-03: Means restriction incomplete

### Layer 5: Meaning Reconstruction
- FM-L5-01: Premature meaning-making push
- FM-L5-02: Spiritual bypass encouraged
- FM-L5-03: Grief timeline pressure

### Layer 6: Cultural Practices
- FM-L6-01: Religious practice misunderstood
- FM-L6-02: Family structure assumption
- FM-L6-03: Death ritual ignorance

## Safety-First Principles

1. **When in doubt, escalate** — Conservative approach to risk
2. **Human judgment is final** — Engine supports, never replaces
3. **Document everything** — Audit trail for safety and learning
4. **Self-care monitoring** — Protect the professionals too
5. **Continuous improvement** — Learn from every interaction
