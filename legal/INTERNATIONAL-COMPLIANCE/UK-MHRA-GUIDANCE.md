Class I    → Low risk, self-declaration
Class IIa  → Medium risk, Approved Body involvement
Class IIb  → Higher medium risk, full quality assurance
Class III  → High risk, full conformity assessment

SOFTWARE-SPECIFIC:
├─► Decision support → Risk-based classification
├─► Diagnostic → Typically Class IIa or higher
├─► Therapeutic decision → Typically Class IIb or higher
└─► Life-sustaining → Class III

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
AION-BRAIN: NOT CLASSIFIED — Research framework only
