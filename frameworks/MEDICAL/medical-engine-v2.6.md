THE v2.6 PHILOSOPHICAL SHIFT

From v2.5 to v2.6 represents a fundamental change:

```
v2.5 Philosophy:
"We have built something effective (we claim)."

v2.6 Philosophy:
"We have designed something that MIGHT be effective.
 We don't know yet.
 Here's how we would find out."
```

This aligns with FSVE Core Principle 1: No Free Certainty

Certainty in medical AI must be:

1. Earned through validation
2. Quantified with confidence intervals
3. Bounded by evidence strength
4. Transparent about limitations

Medical Engine v2.6 has zero certainty.
But it now has integrity.
