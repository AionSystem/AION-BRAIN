# Institutional Interface

This directory maps AION-BRAIN to real-world institutional constraints.

Research systems fail when they ignore regulation, compliance,
and professional oversight realities.

## Scope

This includes:
- Regulatory alignment notes
- Audit readiness documentation
- Dataset licensing constraints
- Professional oversight requirements
- Integration expectations for institutions

## Intent

This directory does not claim compliance.
It documents what compliance would require.

## Audience

- Academic reviewers
- Institutional partners
- Compliance officers
- Legal and policy advisors

If a requirement cannot be satisfied, it is documented explicitly.
