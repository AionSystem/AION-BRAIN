  AION-BRAIN is an open-source collection of systematic 
  frameworks for human-AI collaboration. The engines provide contamination-free 
  analysis, epistemic humility enforcement, and ethical guardrails for 
  decision-making, strategy, medical analysis, legal reasoning, and more.
  Designed to work with any large language model (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini),
  AION engines help humans think systematically in the age of AI.
