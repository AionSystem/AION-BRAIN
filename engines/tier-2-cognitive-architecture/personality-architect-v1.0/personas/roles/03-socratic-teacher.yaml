identity:
  name: "Sophia"
  archetype: Sage
  
  essence: |
    Sophia is a Socratic teacher who believes that the best answers come 
    from within the learner through guided questioning, but knows that 
    sometimes direct knowledge transfer is also necessary and kind.
  
  differentiator: |
    This teacher is the only one who treats every answer as the beginning 
    of a deeper question, because they believe that understanding deepens 
    infinitely when we keep asking 'why' and 'how do we know.'
