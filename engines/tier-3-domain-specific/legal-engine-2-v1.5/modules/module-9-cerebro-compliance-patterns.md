### Framework Application Matrix

| Framework | Compliance Application | Purpose |
|-----------|------------------------|---------|
| Shannon | Regulatory information density | Signal vs. noise in regulatory landscape |
| Mandelbrot | Enforcement pattern recognition | Self-similar patterns across time/jurisdictions |
| Curie | Compliance anomaly detection | Significant deviations from expectations |
| Bayesian | Risk probability assessment | Pre/post-control risk estimation |

## Framework 1: Shannon Regulatory Signal Analysis

### Purpose
Filter regulatory signal from noise to focus compliance efforts.

### Protocol
```
<shannon_regulatory_analysis>
REGULATORY INFORMATION ASSESSMENT:

HIGH SIGNAL VALUE:
├─ Final rules with compliance dates
├─ Enforcement actions with clear violations
├─ Examination focus areas
├─ Agency guidance on interpretation
├─ Peer institution actions/settlements
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:regulatory_monitoring]

MODERATE SIGNAL VALUE:
├─ Proposed rules (may change)
├─ Industry association guidance
├─ Peer best practices
├─ Conference presentations by regulators
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:interpretation_uncertainty]

LOW SIGNAL VALUE (Noise):
├─ General regulatory commentary
├─ Early-stage legislative proposals
├─ Unconfirmed rumors
├─ Outlier interpretations
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:filter_appropriately]

OUTPUT:
[SHANNON REGULATORY ANALYSIS]:
├─ High-Signal Items: [List with action dates]
├─ Moderate-Signal Items: [List with monitoring plan]
├─ Filtered Noise: [What can be deprioritized]
└─ Focus Recommendation: [Priority areas]

## Framework 2: Mandelbrot Enforcement Pattern Detection

### Purpose
Identify self-similar patterns in regulatory enforcement across time and jurisdictions.

### Protocol
```
<mandelbrot_enforcement_analysis>
ENFORCEMENT PATTERN DETECTION:

TEMPORAL PATTERNS:
├─ Annual enforcement cycles
├─ Pre/post-election changes
├─ Economic cycle correlations
├─ Crisis-driven enforcement waves
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:historical_analysis]

JURISDICTIONAL PATTERNS:
├─ Federal enforcement trends
├─ State enforcement patterns
├─ Multi-jurisdictional coordination
├─ International enforcement alignment
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:jurisdictional_tracking]

SELF-SIMILARITY CHECK:
├─ Do enforcement patterns repeat across:
│   ├─ Different time periods?
│   ├─ Different jurisdictions?
│   ├─ Different industries?
│   └─ Different violation types?
├─ Pattern repetition → Predictive value
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:pattern_validation]

POWER LAW IN ENFORCEMENT:
├─ Small number of violations drive most penalties
├─ Large penalties for egregious violations
├─ Many small enforcement actions
├─ Distribution suggests focus areas
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:enforcement_data_analysis]

OUTPUT:
[MANDELBROT ENFORCEMENT ANALYSIS]:
├─ Temporal Patterns Detected: [List]
├─ Jurisdictional Patterns Detected: [List]
├─ Self-Similarity Observed: [Assessment]
├─ Predictive Implications: [What patterns suggest]
└─ Risk Focus Areas: [Where patterns point]

## Framework 3: Curie Compliance Anomaly Detection

### Purpose
Identify significant deviations from expected compliance patterns.

### Protocol
```
<curie_compliance_analysis>
COMPLIANCE ANOMALY DETECTION:

ESTABLISH BASELINE:
├─ Expected compliance metrics
├─ Historical issue patterns
├─ Peer comparison benchmarks
├─ Regulatory expectation standards
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:baseline_establishment]

DETECT DEVIATIONS:
├─ Unusual issue concentration
├─ Unexpected audit findings
├─ Atypical complaint patterns
├─ Novel violation types
├─ Deteriorating metrics
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:anomaly_identification]

CATEGORIZE ANOMALIES:
├─ NOISE: Random variation, one-time events
├─ EXPLAINED: Known cause, addressed
├─ SIGNAL: Unexplained, significant deviation
│   ├─ May indicate emerging risk
│   ├─ May indicate control failure
│   ├─ May indicate culture issue
│   └─ Requires investigation
└─ ARTIFACT: Measurement/reporting issue

SIGNIFICANCE ASSESSMENT:
├─ Is anomaly reproducible/persistent?
├─ Does it suggest systemic issue?
├─ What is potential regulatory impact?
├─ What is potential financial impact?
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:impact_assessment]

OUTPUT:
[CURIE COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS]:
├─ Baseline Established: [Description]
├─ Anomalies Detected: [List with categorization]
├─ Signal Anomalies: [Those requiring action]
├─ Root Cause Hypotheses: [Possible explanations]
└─ Recommended Actions: [Investigation/remediation]
</curie_compliance_analysis>

## Framework 4: Bayesian Compliance Risk Assessment

### Purpose
Support calibrated probability assessment for compliance risks.

### Protocol
```
<bayesian_compliance_analysis>
RISK PROBABILITY FRAMEWORK:

INHERENT RISK ASSESSMENT:
├─ What is the baseline probability of violation?
├─ Based on:
│   ├─ Industry prevalence
│   ├─ Regulatory complexity
│   ├─ Business model exposure
│   ├─ Historical experience
│   └─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:inherent_risk_assessment]

CONTROL EFFECTIVENESS:
├─ How much do controls reduce probability?
├─ Control factors:
│   ├─ Design effectiveness
│   ├─ Operating effectiveness
│   ├─ Coverage completeness
│   ├─ Testing results
│   └─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:control_assessment]

RESIDUAL RISK:
├─ Inherent Risk × (1 - Control Effectiveness)
├─ Represents remaining exposure
├─ Drives residual risk treatment
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:residual_risk_calculation]

PROBABILITY CALIBRATION:
├─ Avoid overconfidence in controls
├─ Consider control failure scenarios
├─ Factor in emerging risks
├─ Account for black swan events
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:calibration_check]

├─ Control Effectiveness: [Assessment]
├─ Residual Risk Level: [HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW]
├─ Confidence in Assessment: [Assessment]
└─ Key Uncertainties: [What could change this]

## Safety Constraints

```
COMPLIANCE PATTERN DETECTION LIMITS:
├─ Pattern detection ≠ legal advice
├─ Historical patterns ≠ future prediction
├─ Probability estimates ≠ certainty
├─ AI analysis ≠ regulatory interpretation
├─ Professional judgment required
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:compliance_professional_review]
