## 2. GRANT OF COPYRIGHT LICENSE

By submitting a Contribution, You grant to Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license — with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers — to:

- Reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions
- Use Your Contributions in any current or future version of the Software or Specifications
- License Your Contributions under any license terms Licensor chooses, including more restrictive or more permissive terms than currently apply
- Include Your Contributions in commercial products or services without compensation to You

## 3. GRANT OF PATENT LICENSE

By submitting a Contribution, You grant to Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free patent license to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution and derivative works thereof, where such license applies to patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution.

---

## 4. NO JOINT AUTHORSHIP

**You expressly acknowledge and agree that:**

- Your Contribution does not create joint authorship of the Software, Specifications, or any other work in this repository as a whole
- You make no claim to ownership of any portion of the AION-BRAIN repository beyond the specific content of Your Contribution
- All rights to Your Contribution are granted exclusively to Licensor under the terms of this Agreement
- Joint authorship requires mutual intent to create a unified work. Contributions to an existing project do not create joint authorship absent explicit written agreement signed by Licensor

This waiver is a material term of this Agreement. No Contribution is accepted without it.

---

## 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

You represent and warrant that:

- You are the original author of Your Contribution, or have sufficient rights to grant the licenses herein
- Your Contribution does not infringe any third-party intellectual property rights — including patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets
- Your Contribution does not include any material that is subject to conflicting license terms that would prevent You from granting the rights herein
- If You are submitting on behalf of an organization, You have authority to bind that organization to these terms
- You have not entered into any agreement that would conflict with this Agreement

---

## 6. MORAL RIGHTS

To the extent permitted by applicable law, You waive all moral rights in Your Contribution including rights of attribution, integrity, and disclosure, to the extent necessary for Licensor to exercise the rights granted herein.

---

## 7. NO OBLIGATION TO INCLUDE

This Agreement does not obligate Licensor to include Your Contribution in the Software or Specifications. Licensor retains sole discretion over which Contributions are accepted.

---

## 8. ATTRIBUTION

Licensor may, but is not required to, acknowledge Your Contribution in repository documentation, release notes, or credits. Attribution is a courtesy, not a contractual obligation.

---

## 9. GOVERNING LAW

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which Licensor is domiciled at the time of execution, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

---

## 10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between You and Licensor with respect to Your Contributions. It supersedes all prior oral or written agreements regarding Contributions.

---

## HOW TO INDICATE ACCEPTANCE

Acceptance of this CLA is indicated by:
- Submitting a pull request to this repository, OR

Both acts constitute your acceptance of these terms.
