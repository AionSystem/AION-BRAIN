# Layer 3: Grief Assessment Module

**Classification:** Crisis & Grief Engine v1.5 Core Layer
**Priority:** High
**Function:** Comprehensive grief assessment frameworks for clinical use

---

## 1. Module Overview

The Grief Assessment Layer provides structured frameworks for evaluating grief type, intensity, trajectory, and potential complications. This module supports clinical decision-making but does NOT replace professional assessment.

### Core Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Grief Type Identification | Distinguish normal, complicated, disenfranchised grief |
| Intensity Assessment | Measure current grief severity |
| Trajectory Evaluation | Assess grief progression over time |
| Complication Screening | Identify risk factors for prolonged grief |
| Cultural Consideration | Account for cultural grief variations |

---

## 2. Grief Type Classification

### 2.1 Normal (Uncomplicated) Grief

**Characteristics:**
- Acute distress following loss
- Gradual adaptation over time
- Functional impairment that improves
- Ability to re-engage with life
- Oscillation between grief and restoration

**Timeline Expectations:**
- Acute grief: Days to weeks
- Active mourning: Months to 1-2 years
- Integrated grief: Ongoing but manageable

**⚠️ Note:** Timeline varies significantly by individual, relationship, and culture. Do not pathologize grief based on duration alone.

### 2.2 Complicated Grief (Prolonged Grief Disorder)

**DSM-5-TR Criteria (Prolonged Grief Disorder):**

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Death of close person | At least 12 months ago (adults), 6 months (children) |
| Persistent yearning | Daily or nearly daily |
| Additional symptoms | 3+ of 8 specific symptoms |
| Functional impairment | Significant distress or impairment |
| Duration | Beyond expected norms |
| Not better explained | By other conditions |

**Eight Specific Symptoms:**
1. Identity disruption (feeling part of self has died)
2. Marked sense of disbelief about the death
3. Avoidance of reminders
4. Intense emotional pain
5. Difficulty reintegrating into life
6. Emotional numbness
7. Feeling life is meaningless
8. Intense loneliness

### 2.3 Disenfranchised Grief

**Definition:** Grief that is not openly acknowledged, socially validated, or publicly mourned.

**Common Contexts:**
| Context | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Relationship | Loss of ex-partner, affair, online relationship |
| Cause of death | Suicide, overdose, stigmatized illness |
| Type of loss | Perinatal loss, pet loss, symbolic losses |
| Griever | Young children, elderly, cognitively impaired |
| Circumstances | Losses during conflict, anticipated death |
