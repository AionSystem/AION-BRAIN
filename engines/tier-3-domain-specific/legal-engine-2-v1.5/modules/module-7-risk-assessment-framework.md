## 3. Risk Assessment Methodology

### 3.1 Risk Identification Process

```
LEGAL RISK IDENTIFICATION PROTOCOL
==================================

STEP 1: DOCUMENT REVIEW
├─ Contracts and agreements
├─ Policies and procedures
├─ Litigation history
├─ Regulatory correspondence
├─ Insurance claims history
├─ Internal audit findings
└─ Compliance assessments

STEP 2: STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS
├─ General Counsel/Legal team
├─ Business unit leaders
├─ Compliance officers
├─ Risk management
├─ Human Resources
├─ Finance/Accounting
└─ Operations/IT

STEP 3: EXTERNAL SCANNING
├─ Industry enforcement trends
├─ Peer company litigation
├─ Regulatory developments
├─ Market/technology changes
├─ Geopolitical factors
└─ Economic conditions

STEP 4: SCENARIO ANALYSIS
├─ "What if" scenarios
├─ Black swan events
├─ Emerging risk identification
├─ Interconnected risk mapping
└─ Cascade effect analysis

OUTPUT:
[RISK_REGISTER]
├─ Risk ID: [Unique identifier]
├─ Category: [From taxonomy]
├─ Description: [Specific risk]
├─ Source: [How identified]
├─ Owner: [Responsible party]
└─ Status: [New/Active/Monitoring/Closed]
```

### 3.2 Risk Scoring Framework

```
LEGAL RISK SCORING MATRIX
=========================

LIKELIHOOD ASSESSMENT:
| Score | Level | Description | Probability |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 5 | Almost Certain | Expected to occur | >90% |
| 4 | Likely | Probably will occur | 60-90% |
| 3 | Possible | May occur | 30-60% |
| 2 | Unlikely | Could occur but doubtful | 10-30% |
| 1 | Rare | May occur only in exceptional circumstances | <10% |

IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
| Score | Level | Financial | Reputational | Operational |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| 5 | Catastrophic | >$50M | Existential | Business failure |
| 4 | Major | $10-50M | Severe damage | Major disruption |
| 3 | Moderate | $1-10M | Significant | Moderate impact |
| 2 | Minor | $100K-1M | Limited | Minor disruption |
| 1 | Insignificant | <$100K | Minimal | Negligible |

RISK SCORE = Likelihood × Impact (1-25)

RISK PRIORITY:
| Score | Priority | Response |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 20-25 | Critical | Immediate action, board attention |
| 15-19 | High | Near-term action, senior management |
| 10-14 | Medium | Planned response, management attention |
| 5-9 | Low | Monitor, routine controls |
| 1-4 | Minimal | Accept or minimal controls |
```

## 4. Risk Response Strategies

### 4.1 Response Options

```
LEGAL RISK RESPONSE FRAMEWORK
=============================

AVOID:
├─ Exit the activity creating the risk
├─ Terminate relationship with risk source
├─ Decline transaction or market entry
├─ Appropriate for unacceptable risk/reward
└─ Example: Exiting market with adverse regulatory environment

MITIGATE:
├─ Implement controls to reduce likelihood
├─ Limit exposure to reduce impact
├─ Transfer through contract provisions
├─ Insurance coverage
├─ Example: Enhanced compliance program, indemnification clauses

TRANSFER:
├─ Insurance (D&O, E&O, cyber, etc.)
├─ Contractual indemnification
├─ Hold harmless agreements
├─ Outsourcing with risk allocation
└─ Example: Purchasing adequate insurance coverage

ACCEPT:
├─ Acknowledge residual risk
├─ Within risk appetite
├─ Monitor for changes
├─ Reserve/budget for potential loss
└─ Example: Normal commercial litigation exposure

RESPONSE DOCUMENTATION:
[RISK_RESPONSE]
├─ Risk ID: [Reference]
├─ Response Strategy: [Avoid/Mitigate/Transfer/Accept]
├─ Actions: [Specific steps]
├─ Owner: [Responsible party]

```
LEGAL RISK QUANTIFICATION

SINGLE MATTER EXPOSURE:
├─ Best case: [Favorable resolution amount]
├─ Expected case: [Most likely outcome]
├─ Worst case: [Maximum exposure]
├─ Defense costs: [Anticipated legal fees]
└─ Total exposure range: [Low - High]

PORTFOLIO EXPOSURE:
├─ Sum of individual matter exposures
├─ Correlation adjustments (related matters)
├─ Insurance recovery offsets
├─ Timing considerations
└─ Net exposure after mitigation

MONTE CARLO SIMULATION (Complex Matters):

├─ Run simulation iterations (10,000+)
├─ Generate exposure distribution
├─ Calculate percentiles (P50, P75, P90, P95)
└─ Confidence intervals

RESERVE RECOMMENDATION:
├─ Probable and estimable: Full reserve
├─ Reasonably possible: Disclosure only
├─ Remote: No disclosure required
└─ Range: Reserve at low end per GAAP

OUTPUT:
