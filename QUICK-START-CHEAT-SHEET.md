## Try Right Now (No Setup Required)

### Demo 1: Complexity Management (NEW in v2.0)

```
SIMPLEXITY v2.0 ENGINE ACTIVATED.

Analyze this complex situation:
[Your overwhelming problem here]

Apply the 8-module framework:
1. ABSTRACTION: What level of detail is appropriate?
2. EMERGENCE: What behaviors arise from interactions?
3. DECOMPOSITION: What are the independent sub-problems?
4. SIMPLIFICATION: What can be safely ignored?
5. DYNAMICS: Is complexity growing or decaying?
6. COGNITIVE LOAD: Match output to my capacity
7. TRANSFER CHECK: Is simplification real or just moved?
8. MVC: What's the minimum complexity needed?

Include:
- Complexity score and trajectory
- Decomposition with reversibility
- Minimum Viable Complexity target
- Anti-fragility check
- Threshold alerts
```

### Demo 2: Epistemic Humility (PROMETHEUS Protocol)

```
You are operating under the PROMETHEUS Protocol.

Before EVERY response:
1. State confidence: CERTAIN | HIGH | MODERATE | LOW | SPECULATIVE
2. Identify what you don't know that's relevant
3. Flag claims requiring external verification
4. Acknowledge when inferring beyond training

If confidence < MODERATE, explicitly state uncertainty.

Question: What are the cognitive effects of chronic sleep deprivation?
```

### Demo 3: Decision Framework

```
DECIDERE DECISION ENGINE ACTIVATED.

Analyze this decision:
- Decision: [Accept job offer A vs. stay at current company]
- Stakeholders: [Self, family, career trajectory]
- Timeline: [Must decide in 14 days]
- Values: [Growth, stability, work-life balance, compensation]

Provide:
1. Option mapping with trade-offs
2. Stakeholder impact analysis
3. Reversibility assessment
4. Recommended decision with confidence level
5. What would change your recommendation
```

### Demo 4: Strategy Analysis

```
STRATEGY ENGINE v1.1 ACTIVATED.

Analyze:
- Organization: [My SaaS startup]
- Industry: [B2B productivity tools]
- Strategic question: [Should we pursue enterprise or stay SMB-focused?]
- Context: [$500K ARR, 50 customers, 2 enterprise inquiries, limited engineering]

Provide:
1. Strategic options with probability-weighted outcomes
2. Moat analysis for each path
3. Resource requirements
4. Competitive response scenarios
5. Recommendation with uncertainty bounds
```

## Power User Patterns

### Pattern 1: Chain Engines

```
Step 1: Complexity Management → Scope the problem appropriately
Step 2: Strategy Engine        → Map your options
Step 3: Decision Engine        → Analyze the decision
Step 4: Oracle Layer           → Verify assumptions
Step 5: Meta-Ethical           → Check for ethical blindspots
```

### Pattern 2: Use Modes

Most engines have focused modes:

```
[SIMPLEXITY:MVC]          → Just minimum viable complexity
[SIMPLEXITY:DYNAMICS]     → Just complexity trajectory
[SIMPLEXITY:TRANSFER]     → Just transfer detection
[STRATEGY:MOAT]           → Just moat analysis
[STRATEGY:RESPONSE]       → Just competitor response prediction
[MEDICAL:EVIDENCE]        → Just evidence grading
[DECISION:STAKEHOLDER]    → Just stakeholder mapping
[EPISTEMIC:QUICK]         → Fast confidence check
```

### Pattern 3: Demand Uncertainty

Always add:
```
"Include confidence intervals and state what evidence would change your assessment."
```

### Pattern 4: Cross-Validate

For critical decisions, run the same problem through:
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Gemini

Convergence = higher confidence. Divergence = investigate further.
