The full stack. FSVE, AION, ASL, CDIP, GENESIS, CPA-001, LAV, DERU, MENSCAPE and more. Every framework has version history, epistemic tags, convergence state, and open questions documented.

---

### Governance

## HONEST STATE

Two frameworks FCL-validated to M-STRONG: **FSVE v3.5** (30 entries, EV 0.813) and **LAV v1.5** (45 entries, 77.5% running mean). Three frameworks specified, validation in progress: AION v3.0, ASL v2.0, GENESIS v1.0. Proprietary stack — MENSCAPE, DERU, ANCHOR — active and not open-sourced. M-NASCENT on new components. Every convergence state is documented honestly. Nothing is overclaimed.
