## Quick Start Tutorials

### Your First Engine Query

**Objective:** Execute your first AION-BRAIN engine query and understand the output.

**Prerequisites:** Access to ChatGPT, Claude, or any GPT-4 class model.

**Steps:**

1. **Navigate to the Oracle Layer**
   ```
   engines/tier-1-foundation/oracle-layer-v2.1/
   ```

2. **Open the prompt file**
   ```
   oracle-layer-v2.1-prompt.md
   ```

3. **Copy the entire prompt** into your AI interface

4. **Add your query at the end:**
   ```
   QUERY: What are the three laws of thermodynamics?
   ```

5. **Review the structured output:**
   - Verified claims (with sources)
   - Confidence levels
   - Uncertainty acknowledgments
   - Citation requirements

**Success Criteria:** You receive a structured response that clearly separates verified facts from uncertain claims.

---

### Understanding Structured Output

**Objective:** Learn to read and use AION-BRAIN's structured output format.

**Key Output Components:**

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Verification Status** | Claim accuracy | `VERIFIED`, `UNCERTAIN`, `UNVERIFIABLE` |
| **Confidence Level** | Certainty measure | `HIGH (>90%)`, `MEDIUM (60-90%)`, `LOW (<60%)` |
| **Source Citation** | Evidence trail | `[Source: FDA.gov, 2024]` |
| **Epistemic Flags** | Knowledge limits | `REQUIRES_EXPERT_VERIFICATION` |
| **Reasoning Trace** | Logic chain | Step-by-step analysis |

**Exercise:** Run the same query through Oracle Layer and CEREBRO-Lite. Compare the output structures.

---

### Choosing the Right Engine

**Objective:** Develop intuition for engine selection.

**Decision Matrix:**

| If You Need To... | Use This Engine |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Verify factual claims | Oracle Layer v2.1 |
| Make a structured decision | Decision Engine v1.0 |
| Analyze complex problems | CEREBRO-Lite v1.0 |
| Develop business strategy | Strategy Engine v1.1 |
| Assess ethical implications | Meta-Ethical Engine v2.1 |
| Support clinical decisions | Medical Engine v2.6 |
| Perform legal analysis | Legal Engine v2.2 |

**Exercise:** Given these scenarios, which engine would you choose?

1. "Should we acquire this competitor?" → *Strategy Engine*
2. "Is this medical claim accurate?" → *Oracle Layer + Medical Engine*
3. "What are the ethical implications of this AI feature?" → *Meta-Ethical Engine*
