## What This Is

AION-BRAIN is a research architecture built on five interlocking validation frameworks designed for structured evaluation of AI outputs — epistemic validity scoring, fragility mapping, graduated safety, pattern validation, and lexical precision QA.

**Not** a production system. **Not** a collection of AI engines. **Not** a benchmark suite.

This is the methodological infrastructure that powers the **AI Reliability Snapshot** service — the frameworks run in the background, the client receives a plain-language report.

**Where this connects to the service:**

```
AION-BRAIN frameworks  →  Evaluation methodology
        ↓
AI Reliability Snapshot  →  What the client receives
        ↓
5–7 page executive report  →  GREEN / AMBER / RED / GRAY per output
```

One framework has already reached M-STRONG: ECF v0.5 completed 30 real FCL entries across 6 validation cycles with 0 intent-fidelity failures and EV: 0.716. The FCL methodology is proven before it is asked to do anything else.

---

## Core Frameworks

All frameworks share: normalized [0,1] scoring, self-application protocols, unified validation kernel (UVK), operational definition registry (ODR), nullification boundary protocol (NBP), and framework calibration logs (FCL v2.6 — M-STRONG).

**Auditing Stack Convergence:** M-MODERATE (internally consistent, empirically unvalidated)
**ECF Convergence:** M-STRONG (30 real FCL entries · 0 failures · EV: 0.716)

---

### 1. FSVE v3.5 — Foundational Scoring & Validation Engine

**Purpose:** Epistemic validity assessment with zero tolerance for false certainty.

**Core Metrics (6 non-interchangeable classes):**
- Confidence — Intent structure quality
- Certainty — Challenge resistance degree
- Validity — Meta-legitimacy of scoring method
- Completeness — Surface coverage assessment
- Consistency — Internal coherence measure
- Risk Exposure — Damage magnitude × likelihood

**Five Non-Negotiable Principles:**
1. No Free Certainty — High scores require evidence
2. Uncertainty Conserved — Cannot be silently erased
3. Scores Are Claims — All scores are falsifiable assertions
4. Invalidatability Required — Must specify failure conditions
5. Structural Honesty Precedes Accuracy — Admit limits before claiming performance

**Hard Threshold:** `Validity < 0.40` → All downstream processes suspended

**Convergence:** M-MODERATE (0/5 FCL entries)

**Documentation:** [`/frameworks/FSVE/`](frameworks/FSVE/)

---

### 2. AION v3.0 — Structural Continuum Architecture

**Purpose:** Meta-analytical system evaluation and failure-state extraction.

**Deliverables:**
- System Identity Mapping — Archetype classification with degradation paths
- Failure Vector Extraction — EL × PM × RC compound fragility scoring
- Signal Propagation Models — Cascade analysis across dependencies
- Multi-Perspective Review — 5 reviewer types (Hostile, Naive, Constructive, Paranoid, Temporal)

**Compound SRI Formula:**
```
SRI_compound = 1 - ∏(1 - (EL_i × PM_i × RC_i))
              i=1 to n

Classification:
SRI < 0.40  → LOW fragility
SRI ∈ [0.40, 0.75]  → MODERATE fragility
SRI > 0.75  → HIGH fragility (requires mitigation)
```

**Required Concrete Outputs:**
- Artifact-kill (what breaks)
- Node-kill (where breaks)
- Behavior-kill (when breaks)

**Convergence:** M-MODERATE (0/5 FCL entries)

**Documentation:** [`/frameworks/AION/`](frameworks/AION/)

---

### 3. ASL v2.0 — Active Safeguard Layer

**Purpose:** Execution-time governance with graceful degradation.

**Architecture:**
- Dual-Watchdog — Independent monitors with cross-validation
- Multi-Modal Interlocks — Input/output/state sanity checks
- Bayesian Adaptive Thresholds — Context-sensitive trip points
- 5-Tier Graduated Response — Warning → Constraint → Throttle → Quarantine → Shutdown

**Framework Independence Fallback:** If FSVE/AION fail, ASL continues with conservative defaults.

**Convergence:** M-MODERATE (0/5 FCL entries)

**Documentation:** [`/frameworks/ASL/`](frameworks/ASL/)

---

### 4. GENESIS v1.0 — Generative Engine for Novel Epistemic Systems

**Purpose:** Pattern discovery, validation, and algorithmic composition with integrity guarantees.

**Process Pipeline:**
1. EXTRACT — Discover patterns in source systems
2. VALIDATE — Score pattern legitimacy (PLS) on 7 axes with uncertainty propagation
3. COMPOSE — Combine validated patterns with Composition Integrity Score (CIS)
4. AUDIT — Deployment certification with failure mode coverage

**Pattern Legitimacy Score:**
```
PLS = min(PLS_base, k_bottleneck × min(Axis_i))

PLS ≥ 0.70  → VALID (deployable)
PLS ∈ [0.40, 0.70)  → DEGRADED (use with caution)
PLS < 0.40  → REJECTED
```

**Convergence:** M-MODERATE (0/5 FCL entries)

**Documentation:** [`/frameworks/GENESIS/`](frameworks/GENESIS/)

---

### 5. ECF v0.5 — Emergence Conversion Framework ✅ M-STRONG

**Purpose:** Lexical precision QA layer — detecting imprecise language before it executes, substituting tokens with etymologically grounded alternatives, verifying intent survived the process.

**Validated Results (30 Real FCL Entries):**

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Real FCL entries | 30 |
| Intent-fidelity (BVL) failures | 0 |
| Mean precision gain | +0.41 |
| Mean intent match | 92.0% |
| Calibration grade | EXCELLENT — all 6 cycles |
| Framework revisions triggered | 11 |
| Convergence | M-STRONG (EV: 0.716) |

**Registered Output States (confirmed in FCL validation):**

| State | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| UNRESOLVED | Answer exists, not found in this pass |
| APORIC | Question structurally malformed at lexical level |
| TRANSCENDENT_REFERENT | Real concept; structurally resists lexical precision |
| JARGON_VOID | Simulacrum tokens removed; no underlying concept present |

**Discoveries with direct auditing relevance:**
- JARGON_VOID — Sentences performing the appearance of meaning. Standard content review passes them. ECF catches them.
- WORLDVIEW_CONTAMINATION — Multiple individually authentic words assembling a self-sealing epistemic field. Token-level scanning misses this. Assembly-level scanning catches it.
- Institutional palimpsest — High-ODS etymology hijacked by institutional function. Relevant to AI capability claims and audit responses.

**Convergence:** M-STRONG (EV: 0.716 · 30 real entries · 0 BVL failures)

**Documentation:** [`/frameworks/ECF/`](frameworks/ECF/)
**Validation Archive:** [`/frameworks/ECF/Completed Cycles/`](frameworks/ECF/Completed%20Cycles/)
**Moon-View Instrument:** [`/outputs/ECF-One-Page-Moon-View.md`](outputs/ECF-One-Page-Moon-View.md)

## Shared Discipline Across All Frameworks

### Unified Validation Kernel (UVK)
All frameworks must pass 5 tests: Logical Consistency · Evidence Discipline · Multi-Perspective Review (MPRP) · Replication Viability · Self-Application Mandate.

### Operational Definition Registry (ODR)
Every variable has: measurement protocol · domain specification · inter-rater reliability target (κ ≥ 0.70) · calibration case count · measurement class.

### Nullification Boundary Protocol (NBP)
All claims require: falsification conditions · minimum test count · evidence tags ([D]ata / [R]easoned / [S]trategic / [?]Unverified).

### Framework Calibration Log (FCL) v2.6 — M-STRONG
Empirical validation backbone. 30 real ECF entries, 6 cycles, 0 failures. The methodology is proven. Auditing stack validation runs on infrastructure that has already demonstrated it works.

## Current Validation State

| Framework | Status | FCL Entries | Convergence |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| FSVE v3.5 | Specification complete | 0/5 | M-MODERATE |
| AION v3.0 | Specification complete | 0/5 | M-MODERATE |
| ASL v2.0 | Specification complete | 0/5 | M-MODERATE |
| GENESIS v1.0 | Self-applied | 0/5 | M-MODERATE |
| ECF v0.5 | **M-STRONG** | **30/30** | **M-STRONG** |
| FCL Master v2.6 | **M-STRONG** | — | **M-STRONG** |

**Auditing stack path to M-STRONG:** ≥5 FCL entries per framework required. First client engagement generates the first ANCHOR FCL entry.

## Falsifiable Hypotheses

| Framework | Hypothesis | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| FSVE | Validity < 0.40 correctly predicts system failures | UNTESTED (0/5) |
| AION | SRI > 0.75 systems fail at 2x rate vs SRI < 0.40 | UNTESTED (0/5) |
| ASL | Graduated response sustains operation where unarmored systems shut down | UNTESTED (0/5) |
| GENESIS | PLS ≥ 0.70 patterns compose reliably | UNTESTED (0/5) |
| ECF | BVL back-translation correctly identifies intent degradation | **UNFALSIFIED — 30 entries, 92.0% mean match** |

Negative results published with equal prominence. All FCL entries are public and timestamped before outcomes.

## Applied Use — AI Reliability Snapshot

The AI Reliability Snapshot is the first commercial service built on this stack. FSVE and AION run in the background of every output evaluation. ECF runs on the language in the report itself.

**Three founding spots currently available at no cost.**
