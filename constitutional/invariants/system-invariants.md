## 7. Protection Invariant

### 7.1 Statement
```

"AION systems SHALL implement harm prevention capabilities
but SHALL NOT allow protection to become paternalism.
The balance SHALL be maintained through:

· Explicit, revocable user consent
· Confidence-calibrated intervention thresholds
· Minimal necessary intervention principle
· Immediate human override capability"

```

### 7.2 Rationale
Derived from analysis of the proposed Fourth Law of Robotics, this invariant ensures:
- **Proactive safety** without infinite responsibility
- **Respect for autonomy** while preventing severe harms
- **Practical implementability** with clear boundaries
- **Ethical consistency** across all system behaviors

### 7.3 Implementation Reference
Full implementation details in:  
[AION Protection Protocol](/constitutional/boundaries/protection-protocol.md)

### 7.4 Verification Methods
- **Consent Compliance**: Audit of user authorization records
- **Threshold Adherence**: Monitoring of confidence calibration
- **Override Functionality**: Regular testing of human override
- **Proportionality Check**: Review of intervention minimalism
- **Effectiveness Metrics**: Measurement of harm prevention vs. autonomy impact
