# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors, regardless of background, identity, or experience level.

The AION community is built on the principle that cognitive tools should be universal — accessible to PhD researchers and high school students, Silicon Valley founders and rural teachers, Western thinkers and non-Western cultures alike.

## Our Standards

**Positive behaviors we encourage:**
- Being respectful and constructive in feedback
- Welcoming diverse perspectives and wisdom traditions
- Focusing on what's best for the community
- Showing empathy toward others
- Engaging with epistemic humility (acknowledging limits of your knowledge)
- Supporting fellow pattern-thinkers and systems architects

**Unacceptable behaviors:**
- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Trolling, insulting comments, or inflammatory language
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Any conduct that creates a hostile environment
- Claiming AION work as solely your own without attribution
- Using AION engines for harmful or unethical purposes

## AION-Specific Guidelines

**Intellectual Honesty:**
- Acknowledge when you don't know something
- Cite sources and attribute ideas appropriately
- Report bugs and limitations honestly
- Don't exaggerate engine capabilities

**Collaborative Spirit:**
- Build on others' work with attribution
- Share improvements back to the community
- Help newcomers understand the frameworks
- Celebrate diverse applications and use cases

**Ethical Application:**
- Use engines for prosocial purposes
- Flag potential misuse you observe
- Respect the ethical safeguards built into engines
- Consider downstream impacts of your applications

## Enforcement

**Response Process:**
1. Initial review within 24 hours
2. Investigation with all parties within 72 hours
3. Decision and action taken within 7 days
4. Appeals possible within 14 days

**Possible Actions:**
- Warning (first offense, minor issues)
