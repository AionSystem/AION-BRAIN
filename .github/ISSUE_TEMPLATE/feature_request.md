# 🚀 AION-BRAIN Feature Request

## 🔍 Before You Begin

**Important:** AION-BRAIN is **research software**, not production code. We prioritize:
- Systematic thinking research advancement
- Testable hypotheses with validation protocols
- Cognitive infrastructure development
- Contributions from systematic thinkers

**Have you taken the [Paradox Strategic Assessment](https://github.com/AION-BRAIN/blob/main/assessments/paradox-strategic-assessment.md)?** High scorers receive prioritized review.

## 📋 Prerequisites Checklist

*Confirm you've done the following:*

- [ ] Read [ARCHITECT.md](https://github.com/AION-BRAIN/blob/main/ARCHITECT.md) (project philosophy)
- [ ] Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/AION-BRAIN/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) (contribution pathways)
- [ ] Tried at least one existing engine
- [ ] Feature aligns with AION principles:
  - Epistemic humility (acknowledging uncertainty)
  - Contamination prevention (independent verification)
  - Ethical design (misuse prevention)
  - Accessibility (clear, teachable frameworks)

## 1️⃣ Problem Statement
*What specific cognitive gap or systematic failure does this address?*

**Example format:** "Current AI systems fail to [specific cognitive failure] when [context], leading to [negative outcome]."

**Your answer:**

---

## 2️⃣ Testable Hypothesis
*What falsifiable claim would this feature test?*

**Example format:** "Implementing [mechanism] will improve [metric] by [amount] in [context], falsifiable by [specific test]."

**Your answer:**

---

## 3️⃣ Systems Impact Analysis
*What are the potential second and third-order effects?*

## ⚠️ Important Notes

**Realistic Expectations:**
- Most feature requests will not be implemented
- We prioritize research-grade, systematic approaches
- Implementation depends on funding and community interest
- All features require validation protocols

**What We Look For:**
1. Systematic thinking demonstration
2. Falsifiable hypotheses
3. Second-order effect consideration
4. Alignment with cognitive infrastructure goals
5. Realistic resource awareness

**Next Steps After Submission:**
1. You'll receive acknowledgement within 1 week
2. Status updates via issue comments
3. Potential invitation to Discussion thread
4. Final decision within 4-6 weeks
