## What I Do

I evaluate the AI outputs your business depends on — and tell you exactly where human oversight is required.

Most founders using AI don't have a clear picture of which outputs are safe to act on, where hallucinations are creating hidden risk, or what their real exposure looks like. I make that clear in a structured written report, in plain language, in 48–72 hours.

I use a structured multi-axis evaluation method developed over several years of focused research into how AI systems fail at the output level — where 80% of reliability failures actually live. The report shows you the findings, not the machinery.

## The Service — AI Reliability Snapshot

### What You Submit

One PDF containing the AI outputs your business relies on for decisions. Up to 10 outputs. No calls. No account. No access to your model or infrastructure required.

### What You Receive

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║           AI RELIABILITY SNAPSHOT                    ║

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Doc 01 — Executive Summary
         Plain language. What we found. What it means.
         What to do next.

Doc 02 — Output Classification Table
         Every output evaluated and classified:
         GREEN  ██  Holds — safe to act on
         AMBER  ░░  Review required — verify before acting
         RED    ▒▒  Oversight required — human in this loop
         GRAY   ??  Insufficient signal — unestablished

Doc 03 — Oversight Recommendations
         Specific actions required by zone.
         Exactly where a human must be in the loop.

Doc 04 — Observed Patterns (if present)
         Systemic issues surfaced across multiple outputs.
```

**Turnaround:** 48–72 hours from receipt of your PDF.
**Format:** PDF executive report — signed, dated, yours to keep.

## Who This Is For

Founders using AI in daily operations. Teams making real decisions from AI outputs. Businesses wanting clarity before scaling automation.

High-stakes domains where this matters most: financial advisory, legal, healthcare, hiring, compliance. Standard domains where volume makes it matter anyway: customer communication, operations, internal productivity.

Not for hobby projects. Not for theoretical research.

## After the Founding Round

Once three engagements are complete and validated:

| Stage | Price | What Changes |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| Founding round | Free | Exchange for testimonial |
| Transition round | $150 | Same service, first paying clients |
| Standard rate | $500 | Founding rate — full service |
| Full engagement | $3K–$25K | Expanded scope, larger output sets |

Pricing moves after proof. Not before.

## The Methodology — What Runs in the Background

Every output is evaluated against structured criteria developed over a year of focused research:

Does it hold under the load being placed on it? Does it stay consistent across uses? Does it express appropriate uncertainty? Does it stay within its reliable domain?

The frameworks that power this evaluation are documented in the academic and technical READMEs. You do not need to understand them to use the service. The report is the output — not the methodology.
