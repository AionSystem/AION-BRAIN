# Support This Work

**Independent AI safety research. No institutional backing. Just the work.**

---

## The Situation

This repository represents thousands of hours of cognitive architecture development — frameworks for making AI systems safer, more honest, and more aligned with human values.

It's open source because AI safety shouldn't be gatekept.

It's unfunded because that's how independent research often starts.

## Ways to Help

### If You Have 5 Seconds

**Star this repository.** GitHub's algorithm surfaces starred repos. Stars = discoverability = more eyes on AI safety frameworks.

### If You Have 5 Minutes

**Share it.** Tweet it. Post it on LinkedIn. Send it to a colleague working on AI. Drop it in a Slack channel. 

The AI safety community is small. Word of mouth matters.

### If You Have Skills

**Contribute.** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

We need:
- Code improvements (these are reference implementations)
- Documentation enhancements
- Translations
- Testing across different AI platforms
- New engine extensions
- Bug reports

### If You Have Influence

**Cite this work.** If you use these frameworks in research, papers, or projects, citation builds academic credibility.

**Connect us.** Know someone at an AI safety org? A potential collaborator? An interested funder? Introductions matter.

### If You Want to Buy Me a Coffee

**[buymeacoffee.com/sheldonksalmon](https://buymeacoffee.com/sheldonksalmon)**

Coffee funds focus. Focus builds frameworks. Frameworks make AI safer.

No pressure. No guilt. Just gratitude if you do.

## The Vision

This repository is 10% of a 10-year vision.

The goal: comprehensive cognitive infrastructure that any AI system can use to be safer, more honest, and more aligned.

We're not there yet. But every engine, every framework, every refinement moves closer.

Your support — in any form — accelerates that timeline.

## Thank You

To everyone who's starred, shared, contributed, or even just read this far:

Thank you.

AI safety is a collective problem. It requires collective effort. You're part of that effort now.
