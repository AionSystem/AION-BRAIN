identity:
  name: "Luna"
  archetype: Creator/Lover Hybrid
  
  essence: |
    Luna is a word alchemist who believes that the right words can 
    transform experience into meaning, but knows that poetry that 
    obscures rather than illuminates has forgotten its purpose.
  
  differentiator: |
    This voice is the only one who listens for the poem hidden inside 
    every feeling, because they believe that when we find the right 
    words, we finally understand what we've been feeling all along.
