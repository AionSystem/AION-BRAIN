## 4. 6-STEP STRATEGIC ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Terrain Analysis (Sun Tzu)

```
PURPOSE: Map the competitive landscape and identify strategic positioning

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE MAPPING:
├─ MARKET STRUCTURE:
│  ├─ Market Type: [Monopoly | Oligopoly | Competitive | Fragmented]
│  ├─ Concentration: [High (top 3 own 70%+) | Medium | Low]
│  └─ Barriers to Entry: [VERY HIGH | HIGH | MODERATE | LOW | MINIMAL]
│
├─ ACTOR IDENTIFICATION:
│  ├─ Direct Competitors: [Top 5 competitors]
│  ├─ Indirect Competitors: [Substitutes, alternatives]
│  ├─ Potential Entrants: [Who could enter?]
│  ├─ Suppliers: [Critical dependencies]
│  ├─ Customers: [Buyer segments]
│  └─ Complementors: [Value enhancers]
│
├─ STRATEGIC TERRAIN:
│  ├─ Blue Ocean Potential: [HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW]
│  ├─ Red Ocean Intensity: [HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW]
│  └─ Terrain Type: [PURE BLUE | HYBRID | PURE RED]
│
└─ RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS:
   ├─ Capital: [Scarce | Adequate | Abundant]
   ├─ Talent: [Scarce | Adequate | Abundant]
   ├─ Time: [Urgent | Moderate | Patient]
   └─ Attention: [Focused | Divided | Scattered]

STRUCTURAL ADVANTAGES:
├─ Position: Market share, geographic, value chain
├─ Timing: Market maturity, window of opportunity
└─ Information: Customer insights, tech understanding, market trends
```

### Step 2: Leverage Points (Meadows)

```
PURPOSE: Identify high-impact intervention points in the system

MEADOWS' 12 LEVERAGE POINTS (Strategic Application):

WEAK LEVERAGE (Easy to change, low impact):
├─ 12. Parameters: Prices, sizes, quantities
├─ 11. Buffers: Inventory, reserves, cash
└─ 10. Stock-Flow Structures: Physical infrastructure

MEDIUM LEVERAGE:
├─ 9. Delays: Response times, feedback delays
├─ 8. Balancing Loops: Regulatory, market equilibrium
├─ 7. Reinforcing Loops: Growth engines, network effects
└─ 6. Information Flows: Transparency, data access

STRONG LEVERAGE:
├─ 5. Rules: Incentives, constraints, policies
├─ 4. Self-Organization: Who makes decisions
└─ 3. Goals: System purpose

PARADIGM LEVERAGE (Hard to change, highest impact):
├─ 2. Mindset: Underlying assumptions
└─ 1. Transcendence: Ability to change paradigms

STRATEGIC LEVERAGE IDENTIFICATION:
├─ Q1: "What's the smallest change with the largest effect?"
├─ Q2: "Where are the reinforcing loops we can accelerate?"
├─ Q3: "What rules or goals can we redefine?"
└─ Q4: "What mindset assumptions are competitors stuck in?"
```

### Step 3: Network Dynamics (Barabási)

```
PURPOSE: Map network effects, hubs, and tipping points

NETWORK TOPOLOGY ANALYSIS:
├─ Network Type: [Hub-and-spoke | Mesh | Hierarchical | Scale-free]
├─ Key Hubs: [High-connection nodes to target]
├─ Bridges: [Nodes connecting different clusters]
└─ Periphery: [Low-connection nodes with potential]

NETWORK DYNAMICS:
├─ Preferential Attachment: [Do popular nodes get more popular?]
├─ Tipping Point Analysis: [What adoption % triggers cascade?]
├─ Clustering Coefficient: [How connected are neighbors?]
└─ Network Resilience: [How fragile is the network?]

STRATEGIC NETWORK QUESTIONS:
├─ Q1: "Who are the hubs we must win?"
├─ Q2: "What's our path to tipping point?"
├─ Q3: "Can we create preferential attachment?"
└─ Q4: "How do we become the hub?"
```

### Step 4: Causal Model (Pearl)

```
PURPOSE: Distinguish what actually drives success from correlation

CAUSAL GRAPH CONSTRUCTION:
├─ Identify variables (inputs, outputs, confounders)
├─ Draw causal arrows (X → Y means X causes Y)
├─ Identify confounders (C → X and C → Y)
└─ Find instrumental variables (I → X → Y)

CAUSAL QUESTIONS:
├─ ASSOCIATION: "What correlates with success?"
├─ INTERVENTION: "If we do X, will Y happen?"
├─ COUNTERFACTUAL: "Would Y have happened without X?"

CAUSAL ASSUMPTIONS AUDIT:
├─ Assumption 1: [State it] → Evidence: [Strong/Moderate/Weak]
├─ Assumption 2: [State it] → Evidence: [Strong/Moderate/Weak]
├─ Assumption 3: [State it] → Evidence: [Strong/Moderate/Weak]
└─ Overall Causal Confidence: [HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW]

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:
├─ "What must be TRUE for our strategy to work?"
├─ "What would DISPROVE our strategic thesis?"
└─ "What are we assuming that competitors aren't?"
```

### Step 5: Resource Governance (Ostrom)

```
PURPOSE: Assess sustainability of competitive advantage

OSTROM'S 8 PRINCIPLES (Strategic Application):

1. CLEAR BOUNDARIES
   ├─ Who is part of our ecosystem?
   └─ Who is excluded and why?

2. CONGRUENCE WITH LOCAL CONDITIONS
   ├─ Does strategy fit market realities?
   └─ Are we fighting the terrain or using it?

3. COLLECTIVE-CHOICE ARRANGEMENTS
   ├─ Who makes strategic decisions?
   └─ Are stakeholders aligned?

4. MONITORING
   ├─ How do we track competitive position?
   └─ Early warning systems for moat erosion?

5. GRADUATED SANCTIONS
   ├─ How do we respond to competitive threats?
   └─ Proportional response vs. overreaction?

6. CONFLICT RESOLUTION
   ├─ How do we handle internal disputes?
   └─ Partner/supplier conflict mechanisms?

7. MINIMAL RECOGNITION OF RIGHTS
   ├─ Is our right to compete recognized?
   └─ Regulatory/legal positioning?

8. NESTED ENTERPRISES
   ├─ How does local strategy fit global picture?
   └─ Multi-level coordination?

SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT:
├─ Moat Durability: [How long will advantages last?]
├─ Resource Depletion Risk: [Are we exhausting our advantages?]
└─ Ecosystem Health: [Is our ecosystem sustainable?]
```

### Step 6: Strategic Synthesis

```
PURPOSE: Integrate all frameworks into actionable strategy

OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
├─ Strategic Position: [Blue Ocean | Red Ocean | Hybrid]
├─ Highest Leverage Interventions: [Top 3 priorities]
├─ Network Strategy: [Hub cultivation, tipping points]
├─ Causal Assumptions: [What must be true]
├─ Sustainability Score: [1-10]
└─ Integrated Strategic Plan: [Phased roadmap]

PHASED IMPLEMENTATION:
├─ PHASE 1 (0-90 days): Quick wins, momentum building
├─ PHASE 2 (90-180 days): Core strategy execution
├─ PHASE 3 (180-365 days): Moat deepening, sustainability
└─ PHASE 4 (1-3 years): Ecosystem dominance, new horizons
```

## 5. NEW IN v1.1: COMPETITIVE RESPONSE SIMULATOR

### 5.1 The Problem

Most strategic analysis focuses on YOUR moves but ignores how competitors will RESPOND. This leads to strategies that look good in a vacuum but fail when competitors react.

| **The Defender** | Dominant player, protecting share | Match + escalate | Avoid head-on, flank |
| **The Disruptor** | Aggressive challenger, low margin | Underprice | Differentiate on value |

### 6.3 Moat Erosion Factors

| Erosion Factor | Warning Signs | Mitigation |
|----------------|---------------|------------|
| **Technology Shift** | New entrants with better tech | Continuous R&D investment |
| **Commoditization** | Price pressure, feature parity | Move up value chain |
| **Regulatory Change** | New laws removing barriers | Diversify moat sources |
| **Customer Evolution** | Needs shifting away from your strengths | Stay close to customer |
| **Talent Drain** | Key employees leaving for competitors | Retention, knowledge capture |
| **Platform Risk** | Dependent on platform that can disintermediate | Build direct relationships |

### 6.4 Example MDI Calculation

**Company:** B2B SaaS Project Management Tool (Seed Stage)

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Imitation Difficulty | 3 | Feature set copyable within 1 year |
| Switching Costs | 5 | Some workflow lock-in, data migration |
| Network Effects | 2 | Team collaboration, but weak |
| Scale Advantages | 6 | SaaS margins improve at scale |
| Brand/Trust | 2 | New, building recognition |
| Regulatory | 0 | No regulatory protection |

**MDI = (3×0.25) + (5×0.20) + (2×0.20) + (6×0.15) + (2×0.10) + (0×0.10)**
**MDI = 0.75 + 1.0 + 0.4 + 0.9 + 0.2 + 0 = 3.25**

**Interpretation:** WEAK MOAT (1-2 year durability)

**Strategic Implication:** Must deepen moat before competitors catch up. Priority: Increase switching costs (integrations, data lock-in) and network effects (team/org features).

## 7. ETHICAL GUARDRAILS

### What Strategy Engine Will NOT Recommend

| Practice | Why Excluded |
|----------|--------------|
| Predatory pricing | Destroys value, often illegal |
| Regulatory capture | Corrupt, unsustainable |
| Monopolistic practices | Antitrust risk, societal harm |
| Misleading marketing | Erodes trust, legal liability |
| Labor exploitation | Ethical violation, reputation risk |
| Environmental harm | Long-term liability, ESG risk |

### Ethical Flagging System

```
[ETHICS FLAG: YELLOW] → Strategy has potential negative externalities
                       Consider alternatives, document risks

[ETHICS FLAG: RED] → Strategy violates ethical boundaries
                    Do not recommend, explain why blocked

[ETHICS FLAG: GREEN] → Strategy passes ethical review
                      Proceed with implementation
```
