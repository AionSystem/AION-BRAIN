# Contributing to AION-BRAIN

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project thrives on community input.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Using the Engines

The best contribution is using the engines and sharing your experience:
- Open an issue describing your use case
- Share results (with permission) in community discussions
- Document what worked and what didn't

### 2. Reporting Issues

- **Bug reports**: Use the bug report template
- **Feature requests**: Use the feature request template
- **Questions**: Use the question template or Discussions

**Good bug report includes:**
- Which engine and version you used
- What you expected vs. what happened
- Steps to reproduce
- AI system used (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)

### 3. Submitting Pull Requests

**Before submitting:**

### 4. Creating Derivative Engines

You're welcome to create your own engines based on AION principles!

**Structure your derivative:**
```
your-engine-name/
├── your-engine-spec.md       (Full specification)
├── your-engine-prompt.md     (Deployment prompts)
├── your-engine-examples.md   (Practical examples)
├── your-engine.pdf           (Professional PDF)
├── README.md                 (Quick reference)
└── IMPLEMENTATION-MODES.md   (Architectural vs LLM approximation)
```
