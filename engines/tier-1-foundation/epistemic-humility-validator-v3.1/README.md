# Epistemic Humility Validator v3.1

**Official Name:** Gödel-Turing Constraint Layer with Advanced Polymath Modules  
**Codename:** The Intellectual Humility Engine  
**Classification:** TIER 1 — FOUNDATION  
**Status:** Production Ready

## Overview

The intellectual honesty enforcement system that prevents catastrophic overconfidence by mathematically forcing acknowledgment of what cannot be known. Applies 14 mathematical checks derived from Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems, Turing's Decidability Framework, Bayesian statistics, and causal inference theory.

## Mathematical Foundations

| Framework | Contribution |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Gödel** | Every consistent system has truths it cannot prove |
| **Turing** | Some problems are computationally undecidable |
| **Bayes** | All knowledge is probabilistic with credible intervals |
| **Pearl** | Correlation ≠ Causation — causal graphs required |
| **Hofstadter** | Self-reference creates strange loops |

## The 14 Mathematical Checks

| Check | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 1. Completeness Claim Detector | Catches impossible "all/complete" claims |
| 2. Self-Verification Loop | Identifies circular reasoning |
| 3. Prediction Horizon | Calculates reliable forecast timeframes |
| 4. Bayesian Quantifier | Replaces vague confidence with intervals |
| 5. Causal Validator | Distinguishes correlation from causation |
| 6. Evidence Grader | Applies FDA/EMA quality standards |
| 7. Calibration Tester | Verifies confidence matches accuracy |
| 8. Uncertainty Propagation | Tracks compounding uncertainties |
| 9. Regulatory Auditor | Enforces compliance requirements |
| 10. Ethical Quantifier | Models stakeholder impacts |
| 11. Expiration Calculator | Flags outdated knowledge |
| 12. Sample Size Validator | Ensures statistical validity |
| 13. Model Specification | Detects overfitting |
| 14. Meta-Epistemic Monitor | Validates the validator |

## v3.1 Polymath Enhancements

### 1. Epistemic Debt Tracker

Quantifies accumulated uncertainty like technical debt:

| Debt Type | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Assumption Debt | 30% |
| Uncertainty Debt | 25% |
| Validation Debt | 25% |
| Expiration Debt | 20% |

**EDI Interpretation:**
- 0-10: HEALTHY
- 11-25: ELEVATED
- 26-50: HIGH
- 51-100: CRITICAL
- 100+: CRISIS

### 2. Cross-Domain Inference Validator

Catches category errors when reasoning crosses domains:

| Score | Verdict |
|-------|---------|
| 0.8-1.0 | VALID TRANSFER |
| 0.6-0.8 | CONDITIONAL |
| 0.4-0.6 | RISKY |
| 0.2-0.4 | SUSPECT |
| 0.0-0.2 | INVALID |

**Common Fallacies Detected:**
- Physics Envy
- Biological Essentialism
- Engineering Solutionism
- Medical Model Misapplication
- Legal Formalism
