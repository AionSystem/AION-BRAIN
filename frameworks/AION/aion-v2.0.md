```

---

## 1. UNIFIED VALIDATION KERNEL (UVK)

All outputs — including outputs generated by this framework about itself — must pass the following five tests. Failure to pass any test does not invalidate an evaluation; it classifies its reliability tier and triggers the appropriate response protocol.

---

### 1.1 Logical Consistency Test

**Pass conditions:**
- No internal contradiction between claims within a single evaluation run
- No undefined scoring transitions (every score must trace to a defined formula or rubric)
- All acceptance criteria computationally reproducible from inputs alone

**Failure response:** Mark `STRUCTURAL_INSTABILITY` on the affected module. Do not suppress or omit — document in §9 metadata under `degradation_flags`.

---

### 1.2 Evidence Discipline Test

Every evaluative claim must carry two mandatory tags:

**Claim Tag** — epistemic status of the claim's basis:

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[D]` | Data-grounded: derived from documented, verifiable source |
| `[R]` | Reasoned inference: derived from established logical or causal chain |
| `[S]` | Strategic projection: forward-looking, based on pattern extrapolation |
| `[?]` | Unverified assumption: acknowledged uncertainty at the base of the claim |

**Confidence Metrics** — attached to every tagged claim:

| Metric | Symbol | Range | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Confidence Factor | CF | 0–100 | Evaluator's calibrated confidence in the claim |
| Coherence Tension | CT | 0–100 | Degree of internal tension with other claims in the same evaluation |
| Risk Exposure | RX | 0–100 | Consequence severity if the claim is incorrect |

**Convergence Tag** — aggregate signal quality:

| Tag | Criteria |
|---|---|
| `M-VERY_STRONG` | ≥3 independent [D] claims converging; FCL calibration confirmed |
| `M-STRONG` | ≥2 independent claims, mixed [D]+[R]; FCL entry exists |
| `M-MODERATE` | Primarily [R] or [S]; internally consistent; no contradiction found |
| `M-WEAK` | Significant [?] presence; low CF; contradictions partially resolved |
| `M-SPECULATIVE` | Majority [?]; CF < 40; no FCL grounding |

**Hard Rules:**

```
Rule 1:  If Claim_Tag = [?] AND CF > 60 → Invalidate claim
Rule 2:  If claim has no NBP entry (§11) → CF is capped at 40
Rule 3:  If ECI > 1.5 (§2.6) → CF capped at 55 on all framework-level claims
Rule 4:  CF_posterior = CF_prior × P(E|H) / P(E)   [Bayesian update on new evidence]
```

---

### 1.3 Adversarial Robustness Test — Scholastic Module

For any thesis T requiring a convergence tag of M-STRONG or above, structured adversarial review is mandatory:

```
Videtur Quod    →  Two or more structured objections to T
Sed Contra      →  The strongest available counter-position
Respondeo       →  Mechanistic synthesis: what survives both sides
Ad Objectiones  →  Explicit resolution of each objection raised
```

**Failure condition:** If thesis collapses under structured contradiction without valid Respondeo → `Reject` or `Revise`. Partial collapse → downgrade Convergence Tag by one tier.

---

### 1.4 Replication Viability Test

An independent evaluator must be able to reproduce, using only the published specification and provided inputs:

- All failure vectors F = {f₁, f₂, ... fₙ}
- Identity scores across all four CRP-ALPHA axes
- Artifact acceptance decisions
- Fragility classifications

**Pass condition:** Reproduction variance < 15% on all numeric outputs when inputs are identical.  
**Failure response:** Mark `STRUCTURAL_INSTABILITY`. Identify which undefined variable caused the divergence. Add to ODR queue (§10).

---

### 1.5 Self-Application Mandate *(new in v2.0)*

At every version release, the full UVK must be applied to the framework specification itself. This is not optional.

Required artifacts per release:

```
VK_Self_Report:
  version:                  [current version]
  tests_conducted:          [1.1 through 1.4]
  contradictions_found:     [documented list or "none"]
  revisions_triggered:      [documented list or "none"]
  signed_by:                [evaluating agent + date]
  degradation_flags_active: [Y/N + list]
```

Frameworks that do not produce a VK_Self_Report at release are automatically classified `M-WEAK` regardless of content quality.

---

## 2. CORE ENGINE STACK

---

### 2.1 CRP v8.0 — Failure-State Vector Extraction (FSVE)

For subject system S, extract the complete failure vector set:

```
F = {f₁, f₂, ... fₙ}
```

Each failure vector fᵢ must define:

| Field | Symbol | Range | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Exposure Level | EL | [0, 1] | Probability that the failure mode is active under normal operating conditions |
| Propagation Magnitude | PM | [0, 1] | Extent to which the failure cascades to dependent subsystems |
| Recovery Cost | RC | [0, 1] | Normalized cost (time, resources, reputation) to recover from the failure |

**System Risk Index — Normalized:**

```
SRI_n = (1/n) × Σᵢ (EL_i × PM_i × RC_i)

SRI_n ∈ [0, 1]

Classification thresholds:
  SRI_n < 0.25         →  Low Fragility
  SRI_n ∈ [0.25, 0.60] →  Moderate Fragility
  SRI_n > 0.60         →  High Fragility
```

**Mean Structural Resilience Distance** (optional physics-grounded analogy for cascade modeling):

```
λ_R = 1 / (SRI_n + ε),   ε = 0.001

Interpretation: λ_R represents the mean structural "distance" between cascade events.
Higher λ_R → more structural separation between failure modes → lower systemic risk.
Analogous to mean free path in kinetic theory.
```

**Each failure vector must document:**

```
fᵢ:
  mechanism_chain:            [causal sequence, not perceptual description]
  second_order_effect:        [effect on adjacent subsystems]
  third_order_reputation_effect: [downstream signal or institutional impact]
  fragility_shift:            [FS = SRI_n_post − SRI_n_pre if fᵢ activates]
  CF / CT / RX:               [per §1.2]
```

**Failure class minimum set** — every evaluation must classify failures into at least these categories:

1. Signal Compression Failure
2. Translation Failure
3. Visibility Infrastructure Failure
4. Complexity Distortion
5. Institutional Non-Embedding
6. Scope Diffusion

---

### 2.2 CRP-ALPHA — Structural Identity Mapping

Map subject across four axes:

| Axis | Symbol | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| Cognitive Architecture | C | How the subject processes, stores, and retrieves information or strategy |
| Output Modality | O | The form in which the subject's work is externalized |
| Signal Distribution Channel | S | The pathways through which the subject's output reaches decision-relevant audiences |
| Institutional Embedding Level | I | Degree to which the subject is structurally integrated into persistent institutions |

For each axis, define:

| Variable | Symbol | Range |
|---|---|---|
| Structural Strength | SS | [0, 100] |
| Dependency Level | D | [0, 1] |
| Volatility Level | V | [0, 1] |
| Redundancy Level | R | [0, 1] |

**Fragility Score per Axis — Weighted with Noise Floor:**

```
F_axis = (D^α × V^β) − R^γ

Where:
  α  =  Coupling Sensitivity weight     (default: 1.0, domain-calibrated range: 0.5–2.0)
  β  =  Volatility Amplification weight (default: 1.0, domain-calibrated range: 0.5–2.0)
  γ  =  Redundancy Effectiveness weight (default: 1.0, domain-calibrated range: 0.5–2.0)

F_axis ∈ [−1, 1]

Classification (with noise floor ε = 0.05 to prevent misclassification from measurement noise):
  F_axis > +ε   →  FRAGILE
  |F_axis| ≤ ε  →  ROBUST
  F_axis < −ε   →  ANTI-FRAGILE
```

**Weight calibration guidance:**

| Domain | α recommendation | β recommendation | γ recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| High-stakes institutional | 1.5 | 1.2 | 1.0 |
| Individual practitioner | 1.0 | 1.5 | 0.8 |
| Safety-critical system | 1.8 | 1.0 | 1.5 |
| Default (uncharacterized) | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |

---

### 2.3 CRP-CHARLIE — Execution Constraint Layer

For any proposed strategy or artifact, define:

| Variable | Symbol | Range | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Signal Gain | SG | [0, 1] | Normalized demonstrability × institutional relevance (see ODR §10) |
| Complexity Debt | CD | [0, 1] | Normalized maintenance load × cognitive load (see ODR §10) |
| Fragility Shift | FS | [−1, 1] | `SRI_n_post − SRI_n_pre` resulting from strategy execution |

**Weighted Acceptance Rule:**

```
Accept strategy if:   w₁·SG − w₂·CD − w₃·FS > θ

Constraints:
  w₁ + w₂ + w₃ = 1
  w₁, w₂, w₃ ∈ [0, 1]
  θ ∈ [0.05, 0.30]   (domain-calibrated; default: 0.10)

Default weights:
  w₁ = 0.50   (Signal Gain priority)
  w₂ = 0.30   (Complexity Debt penalty)
  w₃ = 0.20   (Fragility Shift penalty)

Safety-critical override:
  w₃ = 0.60, redistribute w₁ and w₂ accordingly

Reject strategy if weighted score ≤ θ.
Reject if CD > SG regardless of FS.
```

**Rationale for weighting:** The default reflects the framework's design principle — signal gain is the primary objective, with complexity debt as the principal constraint and fragility shift as a secondary check. Domain tuning is mandatory when default weights would produce systematically biased decisions.

---

### 2.4 BAPL — Bio-Adaptive Pattern Logic

For biological model B:

```
Translate:  Mechanism(B) → Structural Invariant → Strategic Application
```

**Hard constraints on translation:**

- No metaphorical mapping. Only causal equivalence is permitted.
- The translated mechanism must reduce SRI_n or increase SG.
- Translation must produce a testable prediction or a falsifiable structural claim.
- If translation increases Complexity Debt without measurable structural gain → Reject.

**Translation validation checklist:**

```
☐  Causal chain from B to structural invariant is documented
☐  Structural invariant maps to a defined variable in this framework
☐  Application produces at least one testable prediction
☐  Prediction has a defined falsification condition (NBP entry required)
☐  Complexity Debt of applying the translation < Signal Gain of the result
```

---

### 2.5 RSTL — Reputation and Signal Transmission Layer

**Signal Path Model:**

```
Idea → Artifact → Amplification Node → Institutional Anchor → Reputation Stabilization
```

Missing any node in this chain increases propagation friction. Each missing node must be documented as an active fragility.

**Propagation Friction Index:**

```
PFI = Missing_Nodes + Complexity_Normalized + (1 − Demonstrability)

Where:
  Missing_Nodes       ∈  {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}   (count of absent path nodes)
  Complexity_Normalized ∈ [0, 1]            (CD from §2.3)
  Demonstrability     ∈ [0, 1]              (from ODR §10)
```

**Propagation Efficiency — Division-Safe:**

```
PE = IUP / (1 + PFI)

Where:
  IUP = Institutional Uptake Probability ∈ [0, 1]
  PFI ≥ 0

PE ∈ (0, 1]

Properties:
  PE → IUP as PFI → 0   (frictionless ideal)
  PE → 0  as PFI → ∞   (infinite friction)

Continuous attenuation analogy:
  PE ≈ IUP × e^(−k·PFI),   k = institutional friction coefficient (domain-specific)

Action threshold:  If PE < 0.30 → Redesign artifact or amplification strategy before deployment.
```

---

### 2.6 EHM — Epistemic Health Monitor *(new in v2.0)*

The EHM tracks framework-level epistemic hygiene across versions. It is applied to this framework and to any subject framework under evaluation that presents claims of evaluative authority.

**Epistemic Closure Index:**

```
ECI = (VR / VT) × (1 + TRD) × (1 − MFS)

Where:
  VR  = Validation Refusals (count of external validation attempts declined)
  VT  = Total Validation Attempts (external + internal)
  TRD = Term Redefinition Drift (see below)
  MFS = Mean Falsifiability Score across all core claims ∈ [0, 1]

ECI ∈ [0, ∞)

Thresholds:
  ECI < 0.50   →  OPEN (healthy epistemic status)
  ECI ∈ [0.50, 1.50] →  DRIFT_WARNING — initiate ODR audit
  ECI > 1.50   →  EPISTEMIC_CLOSURE_FLAG — mandatory external peer review
                    CF capped at 55 on all framework-level claims until resolved
  ECI > 3.00   →  Reject framework output as self-referential
```

**Term Redefinition Drift:**

```
TRD = Σ Semantic_Distance(term_vₙ, term_v_{n-1})   for all core terms across versions

Semantic_Distance ∈ [0, 1] per term   (0 = identical, 1 = fully redefined)

If TRD > 0.30 per version → Trigger mandatory ODR audit before release
```

**Mean Falsifiability Score:**

```
MFS = (1/m) × Σⱼ Falsifiability_Score_j   for all m core claims

Falsifiability_Score_j ∈ [0, 1]
  1.0 = claim has a specific, observable, time-bounded falsification condition
  0.0 = claim has no defined falsification condition (unfalsifiable as stated)
```

---

## 3. FAILURE ONTOLOGY

Every failure class must define the following. Failure definitions must be causal, not perceptual.

```
FAILURE_ENTRY:
  class:                        [one of the six minimum classes, or documented extension]
  mechanism_chain:              [causal sequence from trigger to outcome]
  second_order_effect:          [effect on adjacent subsystems or actors]
  third_order_reputation_effect:[downstream signal or institutional impact]
  fragility_shift:              [FS = SRI_n_post − SRI_n_pre]
  CF / CT / RX:                 [per §1.2]
```

**Minimum failure class set:**

| Class | Mechanism Template |
|---|---|
| Signal Compression Failure | High-complexity output is reduced to low-bandwidth transmission; critical structure is lost in translation |
| Translation Failure | Specialized knowledge cannot be rendered in a form that is legible to the target institutional audience |
| Visibility Infrastructure Failure | Valid signal exists but lacks the amplification nodes required to reach decision-relevant actors |
| Complexity Distortion | Complexity Debt accumulates faster than Signal Gain; system becomes inaccessible before value is demonstrated |
| Institutional Non-Embedding | Output reaches audiences but fails to anchor in persistent institutional memory or structure |
| Scope Diffusion | Operational boundary expands beyond what the current artifact or actor can credibly maintain |

---

## 4. ARCHETYPE MATRIX

Evaluate subject against the following archetypes. Each archetype is scored independently.

| Archetype | Definition |
|---|---|
| Infrastructure Theorist | Builds foundational models that others use as substrate |
| Safety Auditor | Identifies systemic failure modes before they propagate |
| Failure Cartographer | Maps the topology of failure across complex systems |
| Meta-Framework Architect | Designs systems for evaluating and improving other systems |
| Institutional Critic | Provides structured challenge to entrenched institutional assumptions |
| Applied Builder | Converts theoretical models into finite, testable artifacts |
| Protocol Designer | Formalizes repeatable decision procedures from informal practice |

**Per archetype, score:**

| Metric | Symbol | Range | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alignment Score | AS | [0, 100] | Match between subject's demonstrated capabilities and archetype requirements |
| Institutional Receptivity | IR | [0, 100] | Probability that the subject's output in this archetype will be received by relevant institutions |
| Build Feasibility (12 months) | BF | [0, 100] | Probability that a public artifact in this archetype can be completed within 12 months |
| Signal Amplification Potential | SAP | [0, 100] | Projected propagation efficiency if highest-leverage archetype is pursued |

**Rejection rule:** Reject any archetype whose acceptance by target institutions depends primarily on the subject's recognition or reputation rather than artifact proof. Artifacts must be independently testable to qualify.

---

## 5. BUILDABLE ARTIFACT CONSTRAINT MODEL

Every proposed artifact must satisfy:

| Requirement | Check |
|---|---|
| Finite | The artifact has a defined completion state |
| Executable | The artifact can be acted upon by a third party without requiring the originator |
| Publicly Testable | The artifact produces outputs that can be evaluated against defined criteria |
| Third-Party Replicable | An independent party can reproduce the artifact's outputs from the specification |
| Produces Measurable Output | At least one output metric is quantitative and documented |

**Acceptance evaluation:**

```
Accept if:   w₁·SG − w₂·CD − w₃·FS > θ   (per §2.3)
Reject if:   CD > SG   (regardless of FS)
Reject if:   any of the five requirements above = false
```

---

## 6. EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORY SIMULATION (2026–2036)

**Simulated paths:**

```
Path A:  Framework Expansion         — prioritize theoretical completeness
Path B:  Applied Artifact Focus      — prioritize finite, testable deliverables
Path C:  Institutional Embedding Hybrid — balance theoretical depth with anchored deployment
```

**Evaluate at Year 1, Year 5, Year 10 across:**

| Dimension | Metric |
|---|---|
| Visibility | Reach into decision-relevant audiences |
| Authority | Institutional recognition of outputs as credible |
| Structural Impact | Measurable reduction in SRI_n in evaluated systems |
| Entropy Accumulation Rate | EAR = dS/dt across structural complexity |
| Authority Growth Rate | AGR = d(Authority)/dt |
| Burnout Probability | Probability of operational collapse from unsustainable complexity load |

**Entropy Accumulation Rate — formal definition:**

```
EAR = −Σᵢ (dp_i/dt) ln(p_i)

Where p_i = probability mass on failure mode i at time t

Interpretation: EAR measures the rate at which uncertainty distributes across 
failure modes. Rising EAR indicates increasing structural disorder.

Path rejection rule:
  If EAR ≥ AGR across three or more consecutive evaluation intervals → Reject path
  Trigger mandatory simplification cycle before continuing
```

**Path comparison metric:**

```
Path_Value = Σ (Authority_t × Impact_t × (1 − Burnout_t)) / (1 + EAR_t)
             for t ∈ {Year 1, Year 5, Year 10}

Select path with highest Path_Value that does not trigger EAR ≥ AGR rejection.
```

---

## 7. UNKNOWN UNKNOWN DETECTOR

Scan subject evaluation for the following systematic blind spots:

| Blind Spot Class | Detection Signal |
|---|---|
| Self-Perception Distortion | Gap between stated capability and demonstrated artifact output |
| Market Misalignment | High internal AS scores for archetypes with low IR scores |
| Execution Overestimation | BF scores > 70 with no documented prior completions in this class |
| Collaboration Repellence | Framework or actor structure that structurally prevents external contribution |

**Confidence cap rule:**

```
If Uncertainty_Mass > MEDIUM across two or more blind spot classes:
  Cap all Confidence_Factors at 70 for the current evaluation
  Document in §9 metadata under degradation_flags
```

---

## 8. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Every completed evaluation must produce the following. All outputs must pass the Fragility Reduction Test: `SRI_n` must not increase as a result of acting on the recommended outputs.

| Output | Definition |
|---|---|
| Core Structural Identity | A precise statement of the subject's current structural position across §2.2 axes |
| Highest Leverage Archetype | The single archetype from §4 with the highest `AS × IR × BF × SAP` product |
| One 6–12 Month Artifact | A finite, publicly testable deliverable satisfying all §5 requirements |
| One Amplification Node | The specific institutional or distribution channel that most reduces PFI |
| One Behavior Elimination | The specific current behavior whose removal most reduces CD or SRI_n |

---

## 9. VALIDATION METADATA

All evaluations must produce the following metadata block:

```yaml
AION_ARCHITECTURE_METADATA:
  subject_id:                 [anonymous descriptor or "SELF" for self-evaluation]
  evaluation_date:            [ISO 8601]

  framework_convergence:      [M-VERY_STRONG / M-STRONG / M-MODERATE / M-WEAK / M-SPECULATIVE]
  
  SRI_n:                      [0.000–1.000]
  ECI:                        [value + threshold classification]
  MFS:                        [0.000–1.000]

  FCL_entries_active:         [count]
  NBP_coverage_ratio:         [claims with NBP / total claims]
```

---

## 10. OPERATIONAL DEFINITION REGISTRY (ODR) *(new in v2.0)*

Every variable used in any equation or scoring rubric in this framework must have an ODR entry. No variable may appear in a formula without a corresponding ODR entry being complete and current.

**ODR Entry Template:**

```
ODR_ENTRY:
  term:                           [full name]
  symbol:                         [abbreviated symbol used in formulas]
  domain:                         [valid range or set]
  measurement_protocol:           [≤150 words; specific and actionable; no circular definitions]
  inter_rater_reliability_target: [Cohen's κ ≥ 0.70 minimum for human-scored variables]
  calibration_case_count:         [integer; minimum 3 before variable is used in live evaluations]
  drift_flag:                     [triggered if definition changes across versions without changelog entry]
  last_validated:                 [ISO date]
  current_version:                [framework version this entry applies to]
```

**Mandatory ODR entries for v2.0 — minimum required set:**

| Variable | Symbol | Domain | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Signal Gain | SG | [0, 1] | Critical |
| Complexity Debt | CD | [0, 1] | Critical |
| Fragility Shift | FS | [−1, 1] | Critical |
| Exposure Level | EL | [0, 1] | Critical |
| Propagation Magnitude | PM | [0, 1] | Critical |
| Recovery Cost | RC | [0, 1] | Critical |
| Institutional Uptake Probability | IUP | [0, 1] | Critical |
| Propagation Friction Index | PFI | [0, ∞) | Critical |
| Demonstrability | — | [0, 1] | High |
| Institutional Relevance | IR_var | [0, 1] | High |
| Maintenance Load | — | [0, 1] | High |
| Cognitive Load | — | [0, 1] | High |
| Volatility Level | V | [0, 1] | High |
| Dependency Level | D | [0, 1] | High |
| Redundancy Level | R | [0, 1] | High |

**ODR enforcement rule:** Any evaluation run that uses a variable without a complete ODR entry is automatically classified as `M-WEAK` regardless of other scores. The incomplete variable must be added to the ODR queue with a completion deadline.

---

## 11. NULLIFICATION BOUNDARY PROTOCOL (NBP) *(new in v2.0)*

Every core claim made by this framework — and every claim made in an evaluation produced by this framework — must have a defined falsification condition.

**NBP Entry Template:**

```
NBP_ENTRY:
  claim_id:                   [unique identifier]
  claim:                      [exact statement of the claim]
  claim_tag:                  [D / R / S / ?]
  falsification_condition:    [specific, observable, time-bounded condition that would
                               demonstrate the claim is false or requires revision]
  minimum_test_count:         [how many independent cases are needed to trigger revision]
  prior_tests_conducted:      [list of documented tests or "none"]
  evidence_against:           [list or "none documented"]
  CF_auto_cap_if_missing:     40
  last_reviewed:              [ISO date]
```

**Framework-level NBP — mandatory entries for AION v2.0:**

The following conditions would require deprecation or major revision of AION v2.0:

```
NBP-FRAMEWORK-01:
  claim: "SRI_n predicts relative cascade failure risk across systems"
  falsification_condition: "Three or more comparable cases in FCL where higher SRI_n 
                           systems demonstrate lower actual failure rates than lower 
                           SRI_n systems, after controlling for domain differences"

NBP-FRAMEWORK-02:
  claim: "The weighted acceptance rule (§2.3) correctly identifies viable strategies"
  falsification_condition: "FCL shows accepted strategies underperforming rejected 
                           strategies in >40% of calibrated cases after Year 1 outcomes"

NBP-FRAMEWORK-03:
  claim: "PE predicts relative signal propagation success"
  falsification_condition: "Three or more FCL cases where low-PE artifacts achieve 
                           higher institutional uptake than high-PE artifacts in 
                           comparable conditions"

NBP-FRAMEWORK-04:
  claim: "AION v2.0 produces more reliable outputs than AION v1.0"
  falsification_condition: "Replication variance on identical inputs exceeds 15% across 
                           five or more cases, or inter-rater reliability falls below 
                           κ = 0.65 on archetype alignment scores"
```

**NBP enforcement rule:** Claims without a defined falsification condition are automatically capped at CF = 40. Evaluations where NBP coverage ratio < 0.60 are classified `M-WEAK`.

## 12. FRAMEWORK CALIBRATION LOG (FCL) *(new in v2.0)*

The FCL is the primary instrument for grounding AION's convergence claims in empirical evidence. No evaluation may carry a convergence tag above `M-MODERATE` until at least three FCL entries exist for the relevant claim type. `M-VERY_STRONG` requires twenty or more entries with published outputs.

**FCL Entry Template:**

```
FCL_ENTRY:
  case_id:                    [YYYYMMDD-NNN]
  subject_descriptor:         [anonymous; sufficient to identify type and context]
  subject_type:               [Individual / Institution / Framework / System]
  evaluation_date:            [ISO date]
  
  AION_outputs:
    SRI_n:                    [value]
    fragility_classifications: [per axis]
    PE:                       [value]
    archetype_scores:         [top 3 archetypes with scores]
    acceptance_decision:      [accepted / rejected strategy or artifact]
    convergence_tag_issued:   [M-tag]
  
  ground_truth_outcome:
    outcome_date:             [ISO date; minimum T+6 months from evaluation]
    outcome_description:      [verifiable observation]
    source:                   [documentation reference]
  
  calibration_deltas:
    SRI_n_accuracy:           [|predicted − observed| / scale]
    archetype_validity:       [Y/N — did recommended archetype prove viable?]
    acceptance_decision_accuracy: [Y/N — did accepted strategy produce SG > CD?]
    false_positive:           [Y/N]
    false_negative:           [Y/N]
  
  framework_revision_triggered: [Y/N]
  revision_description:         [if Y, what was changed]
```

**Calibration thresholds for convergence tag eligibility:**

| Tag | Minimum FCL entries | Required accuracy rate |
|---|---|---|
| `M-STRONG` | 5 | > 65% on acceptance decisions |
| `M-VERY_STRONG` | 20 (published) | > 80% on acceptance decisions |
| `M-MODERATE` | 0 | Not FCL-gated (internal consistency sufficient) |
| `M-WEAK` / `M-SPECULATIVE` | Not applicable | Not FCL-gated |

## 13. FINAL OPERATING PRINCIPLE

This architecture is structurally incomplete — and therefore its outputs should not be treated as authoritative — if it cannot satisfy all five of the following conditions simultaneously:

```
1.  Produce measurable outputs
    The framework generates numeric scores and classifications that an 
    independent party can verify from the same inputs.

2.  Survive adversarial contradiction
    Core claims have passed the Scholastic Module (§1.3) and have 
    documented Respondeo entries.

3.  Be replicated by a third party
    Replication variance < 15% on all numeric outputs when inputs are 
    identical (§1.4).

4.  Reduce fragility under scale
    Applying the framework's outputs does not increase SRI_n in the 
    evaluated system.

5.  Generate a finite public artifact
    At least one artifact produced using this framework satisfies all 
    §5 requirements and has a documented FCL entry.
```

Any version of AION that fails one or more of these conditions must carry an explicit `STRUCTURAL_INCOMPLETE` flag in its §9 metadata until the condition is resolved.
