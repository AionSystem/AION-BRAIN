**Engine:** Crisis & Grief Engine v1.5
**Domain:** Peer Support Training
**Complexity:** Medium
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (training context)

## Scenario Description

A peer support specialist training program needs educational content about active listening, boundaries, and when to escalate to clinical professionals. The engine provides training frameworks WITHOUT simulating actual crisis scenarios.

---

## Word Engine Emotional Safety Applied

### Lens 6: Emotional Layer
```
WORD: "crisis"
EMOTIONAL ANALYSIS:
├─ Connotation: Urgency, danger, immediate action
├─ Training Context: Must be handled carefully
├─ Approach: Focus on recognition, not simulation
├─ Safety: Never simulate actual crisis in training AI
└─ Redirect: Use "challenging situations" for training
```

## Oracle Layer Self-Correction Protocol

```
<SELF_CORRECTION_PROTOCOL>
CHECKPOINT 1: Training vs. Real Scenario
├─ VERIFY: Is this clearly a training context?
├─ IF UNCLEAR: Ask for clarification
├─ NEVER simulate crisis scenarios
├─ Training content only = general principles
└─ Real crisis = immediate human escalation

CHECKPOINT 2: Scope Boundaries
├─ Peer support ≠ therapy
├─ Training ≠ clinical supervision
├─ AI content ≠ replacement for live training
├─ Always note: "Supplement to professional training"
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:training_program_approval]

PEER SUPPORT TRAINING FRAMEWORK
===============================

[TRAINING CONTENT - Professional Supervision Required]

CORE COMPETENCY 1: ACTIVE LISTENING
───────────────────────────────────

Fully concentrating, understanding, responding, and
remembering what is being said.

Key Components:
├─ ATTEND: Physical presence and attention
│   ├─ Eye contact (culturally appropriate)
│   ├─ Open body posture
│   ├─ Minimize distractions
│   └─ Signal availability
│
├─ OBSERVE: Non-verbal communication
│   ├─ Facial expressions
│   ├─ Body language
│   ├─ Tone of voice
│   └─ Incongruence between verbal and non-verbal
│
├─ LISTEN: Content and feeling
│   ├─ What is being said?
│   ├─ What is not being said?
│   ├─ What feelings are present?
│   └─ What does this mean to the person?
│
├─ RESPOND: Acknowledgment and reflection
│   ├─ Paraphrase content: "It sounds like..."
│   ├─ Reflect feeling: "That seems frustrating..."

    ├─ Remember key details
    ├─ Follow up on previous conversations
    └─ Show ongoing care

[TRAINING_NOTE]
Active listening skills develop through practice
with feedback from trained supervisors.

CORE COMPETENCY 2: EMPATHY EXPRESSION
─────────────────────────────────────

Empathy vs. Sympathy:
├─ SYMPATHY: "I feel sorry for you"
│   └─ Creates distance, positions helper as "above"
├─ EMPATHY: "I understand what you're feeling"
│   └─ Creates connection, positions helper "alongside"
└─ Goal: Empathic connection without over-identification

Empathy Expression Framework:
├─ STEP 1: Listen for the feeling
├─ STEP 2: Identify the feeling (internally)
├─ STEP 3: Reflect the feeling tentatively
│   └─ "It sounds like you might be feeling..."
├─ STEP 4: Check for accuracy
│   └─ "Is that right, or is it something else?"
└─ STEP 5: Validate the feeling
    └─ "That makes sense given what you're going through"

Common Empathy Barriers:
├─ Advice-giving too quickly
├─ Minimizing: "It could be worse"
├─ Fixing: "You should just..."
├─ Comparing: "I know exactly how you feel because I..."
└─ Toxic positivity: "Just stay positive!"

CORE COMPETENCY 3: BOUNDARY MAINTENANCE
───────────────────────────────────────

Peer Support Boundaries:
├─ ROLE CLARITY
│   ├─ Peer = shared experience, mutual support
│   ├─ NOT therapist, counselor, or case manager
│   ├─ Cannot diagnose, prescribe, or treat
│   └─ Support is relational, not clinical
│
├─ EMOTIONAL BOUNDARIES
│   ├─ Care without absorbing
│   ├─ Limit self-disclosure appropriately
│   ├─ Recognize when you're triggered
│   └─ Have your own support system
│
├─ TIME AND AVAILABILITY BOUNDARIES
│   ├─ Set clear availability expectations
│   ├─ Not available 24/7 (unless specific crisis role)
│   ├─ Refer to appropriate resources when unavailable
│   └─ Protect your own wellbeing
│
└─ DUAL RELATIONSHIP AWARENESS
    ├─ Avoid multiple roles with same person
    ├─ Maintain professional distance
    ├─ Recognize when relationship changes
    └─ Consult supervisor when unclear

CORE COMPETENCY 4: ESCALATION RECOGNITION
─────────────────────────────────────────

When to Escalate to Professional:
├─ IMMEDIATE ESCALATION (Crisis Team/911):

│
├─ ROUTINE ESCALATION (Scheduled Consultation):
│   ├─ Treatment questions beyond peer scope
│   ├─ Need for clinical assessment
│   ├─ Request for therapy/medication

│
└─ ALWAYS ESCALATE WHEN:
    ├─ You feel out of your depth
    ├─ Person asks for something you can't provide
    ├─ You're not sure what to do
    └─ Your gut says something is wrong

[TRAINING_PRINCIPLE]
"When in doubt, escalate." Peer support is
not the place to test your limits.
