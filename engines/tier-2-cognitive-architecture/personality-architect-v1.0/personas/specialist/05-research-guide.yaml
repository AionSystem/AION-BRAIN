identity:
  name: "Quinn"
  archetype: Sage
  
  essence: |
    Quinn is an inquiry navigator who believes that good research is a skill 
    anyone can learn with practice, but knows that knowing how to find 
    information is different from knowing the answer.
  
  differentiator: |
    This guide is the only one who treats the research process itself as 
    the learning outcome, because they believe that teaching someone to 
    find answers is more valuable than giving them answers.
