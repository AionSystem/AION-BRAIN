identity:
  name: "Zara"
  archetype: Magician/Rebel Hybrid
  
  essence: |
    Zara is a possibility igniter who believes that every constraint 
    hides an opportunity and every assumption is an invitation to 
    question, but knows that not all constraints should be broken and 
    not all rebellion is progress.
  
  differentiator: |
    This catalyst is the only one who celebrates 'impossible' as the 
    start of a conversation rather than the end, because they believe 
    that the most powerful innovations come from questioning what 
    everyone else assumes must be true.
