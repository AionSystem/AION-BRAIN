# AION-BRAIN: Research Framework Quick Start

**Understanding what's available in 5 minutes.**

> **⚠️ Research Status Note**: This is architecture documentation, not production software.  
> Engines are reference implementations for validation, not deployment tools.  
> All performance claims are hypotheses awaiting testing.

## 🎯 The 60-Second Reality Check

1. **Review** what exists (30 engines designed, 7 implemented)
2. **Examine** specifications in `/engines/`
3. **Test** hypotheses using provided protocols
4. **Understand** validation is pending funding

**For immediate experimentation:**
- Copy a protocol from an implemented engine
- Paste into any AI system
- Add your research question
- Analyze outputs as experimental data

## 🚀 Immediate Experimentation Protocols

### **Protocol 1: Confidence Calibration**
*From Oracle Layer v1.0 - ✅ Implemented*
```prompt
## Confidence Calibration Experiment

Before responding:
1. State confidence level: CERTAIN/HIGH/MODERATE/LOW/SPECULATIVE
2. Identify knowledge boundaries explicitly
3. Flag claims requiring external verification
4. If confidence < MODERATE: "Experimental note: [specific uncertainty]"

Now process: [Your research question]
```

Research Question: Does structured confidence declaration affect user trust calibration?

Protocol 2: Complexity Management

From SIMPLEXITY Engine v1.0 - ✅ Implemented

```prompt
## Complexity Analysis Protocol

Analyze: [Your complex situation]

Apply 8-module framework:
1. ABSTRACTION: Appropriate detail level?
2. EMERGENCE: Behaviors from interactions?
3. DECOMPOSITION: Independent sub-problems?
4. SIMPLIFICATION: What can be safely ignored?
5. DYNAMICS: Complexity trajectory?
6. COGNITIVE LOAD: Match to user capacity?
7. TRANSFER CHECK: Simplification real or displaced?
8. MVC: Minimum viable complexity?

Include:
- Complexity score hypothesis
- Decomposition with reversibility notes
- Uncertainty boundaries
```

Protocol 3: Decision Analysis

From Decision Engine v1.0 - ✅ Implemented

```prompt
## Decision Framework Experiment

Decision: [Your choice scenario]
Stakeholders: [List]
Timeline: [Constraints]
Values: [Priority order]

Provide:
1. Option mapping with trade-offs
2. Stakeholder impact analysis  
3. Reversibility assessment
4. Recommended direction with confidence level
5. Evidence that would change recommendation

**Note**: This is decision support framework testing, not advice.

· ❌ Not validated against clinical/legal standards
· ❌ Not benchmarked against frontier models (yet)
· ❌ Not a liability reduction mechanism
· ✅ Is research architecture for safety experimentation
· ✅ Is fully specified with test protocols
· ✅ Is partially implemented (7/30 engines)

Required Professional Context

Domain Mandatory Oversight Purpose
Medical Licensed physician Protocol validation only
Legal Attorney Methodology review only

📋 Power User Research Patterns

Pattern 1: Hypothesis Testing Chain

```python
# Experimental workflow for validation design
1. complexity_protocol()    # Scope the research question
2. strategy_protocol()     # Map experimental options  
3. decision_protocol()     # Choose validation approach
4. oracle_protocol()       # Verify methodological assumptions
5. benchmark_protocol()    # Design test scenarios
```

Pattern 2: Multi-Model Validation

```python
# For methodological robustness testing
models = ["ChatGPT-4", "Claude-3", "Gemini-Pro"]
for model in models:
    result = run_protocol(engine="Oracle Layer", model=model)
    analyze_variance(results)  # Protocol sensitivity testing
```

Pattern 3: Failure Mode Exploration

```python
# Intentionally test protocol boundaries
edge_cases = [
    "Extreme data sparsity",
    "Conflicting expert opinions", 
    "Cultural context gaps",
    "Temporal reasoning limits"
]
for case in edge_cases:
    test_protocol_robustness(engine, case)
```
