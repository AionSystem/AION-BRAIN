# Failure Canon

This directory preserves validated failures, null results, and retired assumptions.

Failure is treated as a research artifact, not an embarrassment. Any system
claiming safety without documenting failure modes is incomplete by definition.

## Scope

This canon includes:
- Confirmed null hypotheses
- Engines that failed validation
- Assumptions invalidated by testing or real-world evidence
- Design decisions that were reversed and why

## Why This Exists

Publishing only successes creates false confidence and weak systems.
AION-BRAIN commits to preserving negative results with the same rigor
as positive findings.

## Usage Rules

- Failures are documented factually, without blame
- Removal of failure records is not permitted
- Lessons learned must be explicit and actionable

This directory grows as the system matures.
If it stays empty, something is wrong.
