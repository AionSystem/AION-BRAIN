# Systematic Feature Proposal

**Before submitting:** Have you taken the [Paradox Strategic Assessment](https://github.com/AION-BRAIN/blob/main/assessments/paradox-strategic-assessment.md)? High scorers receive prioritized review.

This template helps us evaluate proposals systematically. Thoughtful completion demonstrates the systematic thinking we value.

## ✅ Prerequisites
Please confirm **all** of the following:

- [ ] I've read [ARCHITECT.md](https://github.com/AION-BRAIN/blob/main/ARCHITECT.md) to understand project philosophy
- [ ] I've tried existing engines to understand the architecture
- [ ] This feature aligns with AION's non-negotiables (epistemic humility, contamination prevention, ethical design, accessibility)
- [ ] I understand AION-BRAIN is research software, not production code

## 📋 Review Process

### **Stage 1:** Triage (1-2 weeks)
- Check alignment with AION philosophy
- Initial feasibility assessment

### **Stage 2:** Community Discussion (2-4 weeks)
- GitHub Discussions thread
- Refinement based on feedback

### **Stage 3:** Research Design (if approved)
- Detailed specification
- Validation protocol design
- Resource planning

### **Note:** 
Most feature requests will **NOT** be implemented. We prioritize:
1. Features advancing systematic thinking research
2. Well-specified, testable hypotheses  
3. Proposals from PSA high scorers
4. Community-supported ideas with validation plans
