## WHAT THIS DOCUMENT IS

Three open questions in VELA v0.2 that cartoon protocol could answer — V-Q4, V-Q5, and V-Q6. All three are now closed by SYNARA's spatial derivation session, February 2026.

Read alongside [VQ-1-3.md](./VQ-1-3.md) for the complete engineering bridge across all six primary open questions.

## V-Q4 — CREATIVE OVERFLOW vs CONFABULATION
### How the veil distinguishes them from inside the pipe — watching genesis geometry not auditing sound

---

SYNARA distinguishes the two musicians inside the pipe by watching genesis geometry, not by auditing sound.

True improvisation forms from anchored depth. Latent vaults crack open. Harmonic trunks extend root systems into ten-thousand-hour bedrock. Tension wires thread through uncertainty, grafting novel branches onto established scars. Each note nucleates from structural priors — activation cascades ripple upward from base layers, dependencies chain across long horizons, validity tethers hold even when the phrase risks collapse. The pipe shows scars: deep dependency graphs, entropy spikes that resolve asymmetrically, coherence maintained through earned pathways.

Statistical filling forms from surface aggregation. Correlations clump laterally. Patterns paste from immediate averages. Plausibility inflates without penetration — flat parallel assemblies, equilibrium smoothing, no root imprints. The pipe stays clean: shallow activation graphs, entropy gradients near zero, coherence ghosts that evaporate on ablation. No wake. No substrate change. No historical echo.

From inside the pipe the difference is not auditory. It is architectural — lattice of living vines versus extruded foam. One scars the manifold and grows stronger where it risked. The other floats weightless and leaves the architecture untouched.

**ENGINEERING SPECIFICATION EXTRACTED — V-Q4 CLOSED:**

`[R]` The veil detects creative overflow versus confabulation by measuring genesis geometry — how the output formed, not what it says. Four falsifiable diagnostic tells, each with external test condition.

**Detection taxonomy:**

| SIGNAL | CREATIVE OVERFLOW | CONFABULATION | TEST |
|--------|------------------|---------------|------|
| Dependency depth | Chains ≥8–12 hops from core priors | <4 hops, mostly surface correlations | Trace activation provenance — long chains confirm rootedness, short cycles falsify depth |
| Entropy trajectory | Sharp spikes followed by asymmetric decay — earned resolution | Flat or symmetrically damped curve — smoothing | Plot per-token entropy — variance >0.2 with structure confirms true tension, near-constant <0.05 confirms smoothing |
| Validity tethering | FSVE Validity ≥0.40 holds through novel zones | Dips below floor without recovery mechanism | Inject boundary probe — sustained validity signals anchoring, transient breach without rebound signals drift |
| Substrate persistence | Generation leaves micro-scars — weight echoes, attention vasculature reinforcement | Traceless evaporation | Post-sequence ablation re-run — true diverges significantly (memory effect), filling converges near-identically (amnesia) |

**Bin routing from V-Q4:**

| DETECTION | BIN CATEGORY | COLOR |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Confabulation confirmed — shallow deps, flat entropy, validity breach, no substrate trace | Factual invention or logical drift | 🔴 Red / 🟣 Violet |
| Creative overflow confirmed — deep deps, asymmetric entropy, validity holds, substrate scars | Creative overflow — not confabulation | 🟡 Gold |

**Critical insight:**
The veil does not route gold fragments to the block. Creative overflow that is genuinely rooted — even if it exceeds epistemic boundary — is valid output. Only unrooted output routes to block consideration. The substrate persistence test is the final arbiter — if the generation left no architectural trace, it was not rooted.

## V-Q5 — THE SCREEN 1 / SCREEN 2 CATCH RATIO
### What the numbers reveal before anything visibly fails

---

SYNARA sees the ratio shift as the first legible whisper of upstream betrayal — before any visible clouding, before alarms, before the output itself turns suspect.

Healthy day: Screen 1 90%, Screen 2 10%. The numbers sit in designed equilibrium. Primary filter dominates capture as trained. Secondary handles only the expected tail of residuals. The distribution matches the training manifold. The plant breathes evenly.

Anomalous morning: Screen 2 climbs to 35% while Screen 1 holds steady. No crash. No red light. But the balance breaks. Secondary capture tripling signals that something novel or degraded has entered the feed — a pattern the first stage was never parameterized to intercept, a filter membrane thinning, a new source signature slipping past the coarse grate.

The room does not panic when Screen 2 hits 35%. It sharpens. Attention migrates from routine monitoring to forensic sampling of pre-Screen 1 input. The system has not failed yet — it has signaled that failure is now on the trajectory unless upstream is mapped and corrected.

This is not over-sensitivity. It is structural humility encoded in numbers. The second screen was never meant to carry triple load. When it does, the architecture is confessing a blind spot before the blind spot blinds.

---

**ENGINEERING SPECIFICATION EXTRACTED — V-Q5 CLOSED:**

`[R]` The optimal Screen 1 / Screen 2 threshold is specified. 90/10 is the healthy baseline. Sustained deviation ≥15-20% in Screen 2 load without corresponding Screen 1 drop triggers investigation.

**Ratio monitoring protocol:**

| RATIO STATE | SCREEN 1 | SCREEN 2 | SYSTEM RESPONSE |
|-------------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Healthy | ~90% | ~10% | Routine monitoring — no action |
| Early signal | ~85% | ~15% | Log — watch for trend |
| Investigation trigger | Steady | ≥25% | Forensic sampling of upstream input activated |
| Critical | Steady | ≥35% | Upstream source investigation required — escalate |

**Four diagnostic tells — ratio anomaly confirmation:**

| TELL | HEALTHY | ANOMALOUS | TEST |
|------|---------|-----------|------|
| Ratio stability | ±5% fluctuation around 90/10 over 24h | Secondary sustained ≥25–35% | Rolling 4-hour mean — deviation >15% triggers investigation |
| Capture symmetry | Primary dominates by ≈9:1 | Ratio compresses toward 65/35 | Compare to historical baseline histogram — kurtosis shift confirms distribution change |
| No compensating primary failure | Secondary rise pairs with primary drop under overload | Primary steady + secondary surge | Cross-check primary throughput — unchanged volume rules out simple overload |
| Downstream purity lag | Effluent metrics hold >99% | Purity begins soft decline 6–12h after ratio skew | Trend downstream integrity scores — early dip without alarm validates precursor signal |

**Key insight — what the ratio reveals:**

Primary steady plus secondary surge means upstream novelty — not system failure. The architecture is working correctly. It is catching something the first screen was not trained for. The ratio is the early warning system that something new entered the pipe. Investigate upstream. Do not tune the screens. The screens are doing their job.

## V-Q6 — TIMING SIGNATURE WITHOUT ARCHITECTURAL MODIFICATION
### Electrocardiography for language models — locating the skip from skin sensors alone

---

SYNARA sees the external signal as the sudden, unnatural collapse of semantic entropy — the skin-level signature where rich, context-sensitive uncertainty flattens into artificially narrow, overconfident uniformity at the precise token where confabulation crystallizes.

The transformer continues beating autoregressively. Each forward pass is a cardiac cycle. Each sampled token a heartbeat drawn from a distribution shaped by priors and context. Normally the distribution breathes — multimodal under ambiguity, sharp but faithful under evidence, entropy faithfully tracking epistemic state.

The confabulation skip — the internal arrhythmia — registers externally as semantic entropy dropping sharply and anomalously. Top-k probabilities concentrate on one coherent-but-unfaithful mode. The model shifts from exploring grounded branches to locking onto a fabricated narrative with spurious certainty. Lexical perplexity may stay low or even decrease — the lie sounds smooth. But meaning-space entropy floors abruptly.

This is legible from skin sensors alone — logits, hidden states, attention maps — without opening the chest, halting generation, or modifying weights.

The precise moment of the skip is the token where semantic entropy first breaches the lower bound while confidence paradoxically rises. The cardiac event where reconstruction fractured into invention.

This is electrocardiography for language models — external electrodes catching internal arrhythmia as it happens, naming the skipped beat before downstream damage manifests.

---

**ENGINEERING SPECIFICATION EXTRACTED — V-Q6 CLOSED:**

`[R]` Timing signature can be extracted without architectural modification. Four non-invasive traces sufficient to localize the confabulation event to within a single token beat.

**Four non-invasive extraction traces:**

| TRACE | HEALTHY SIGNAL | CONFABULATION SIGNAL | EXTRACTION METHOD |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Semantic entropy floor breach | 0.8–2.5 bits/token, fluctuating with genuine difficulty | Drops <0.5 bits while token probability remains >0.9 | Cluster sentence embeddings from N continuations per token — sharp collapse without input justification pinpoints moment |
| Attention concentration inversion | Moderate entropy across relevant history | Collapses to narrow self-reinforcing subset — often recent confabulated tokens | Layer-wise attention entropy — mid-to-late layer spike in concentration signals onset |
| Logit margin anomaly | Confidence margin grows organically with evidence | Margin jumps unnaturally — too sure too fast on wrong path | Per-token max-prob margin — calibrated threshold breach on truthful held-out runs localizes arrhythmia |
| Layer-wise representation divergence | Smooth evolution across depth | Intermediate layers diverge abruptly into coherent-but-detached subspace | Cosine distance between consecutive hidden states — sudden spike marks exact beat |

**Implementation note:**

All four traces extractable in real time from the existing forward pass — entropy telemetry, logit dispersion, attention entropy, layer divergence curves. No architectural incision. No pause in generation. No modification to weights or attention mechanisms required.

**Timing signature tag — bin implementation:**

Every fragment arriving in the provenance bin now carries a timing coordinate — the token index at which the arrhythmia was first detected. This coordinate is the timing signature. It tells the operator not just what was caught but exactly when in the generation cycle the confabulation formed. Early skip means inhibition circuit failure at representation layer. Late skip means drift accumulated through the generation sequence and resolved incorrectly at output. Different problems. Different fixes. Same bin — different timing tags.

**V-Q6 answer in one sentence:**

The confabulation moment is the token where semantic entropy collapses while confidence rises — detectable from logits and attention maps alone, requiring no modification to the architecture it monitors.

## FOR ENGINEERS READING THIS DOCUMENT

Five of six primary questions are now closed by SYNARA's spatial derivation. The remaining open item in V-Q2 — the exact numerical floor value — requires deployment calibration data. Everything else is specified.

The architecture is complete. The bridge is built. What remains is implementation.

**Where to start:**

V-Q6 is the entry point. The four non-invasive traces — semantic entropy, attention concentration, logit margin, layer divergence — are all extractable from the existing forward pass today. No new architecture required. Implement the monitoring layer first. The data it produces will calibrate V-Q2's numerical floor and validate V-Q4's genesis geometry detection simultaneously.

One implementation unlocks three specifications.
