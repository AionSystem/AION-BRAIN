## SECTION 0 — WHAT VELA IS

`[D]` VELA is a pre-output epistemic and constitutional filtration architecture. It sits between the internal representation layer — where confabulation is generated — and the output layer — where it currently escapes unchecked. No complete architecture currently occupies this position in any deployed AI system.

`[D]` Anthropic's 2025 interpretability research identified the exact internal circuits where confabulation originates — when a model recognizes something but lacks sufficient grounded information, inhibition circuits fail and plausible falsehood exits as confident output. VELA is the engineering response to that finding.

`[R]` VELA v0.3 operates as a dual-layer system with a constitutional layer embedded in Screen 2. Code Layer first. Constitutional and Epistemic Framework Layer second. Two screens. One bin collecting from both. The Eight Laws of the Sovereignty Stack are not external to VELA — they operate inside it at the pre-output layer simultaneously with epistemic filtration.

`[R]` This makes VELA the first architecture where epistemic integrity and constitutional integrity are enforced at the same pre-output point simultaneously. Not two separate pipelines. One veil. Two functions.

**VELA is not:**
- A prompting or prompt engineering tool
- A post-output verification system
- A retrieval augmentation architecture
- A content moderation filter
- A replacement for training quality
- A constitutional AI approach operating at the output layer

**VELA is:**
- A dual-layer pre-output epistemic and constitutional filtration system
- A provenance filament tracing system connecting output to training source
- An immutable reference architecture for clean signal verification
- An ontological source exclusion mechanism with constitutional enforcement
- A live integrity sensor with calibrated epistemic and constitutional pressure axes
- The epistemic bedrock beneath the AION stack
- The constitutional enforcement point for the Sovereignty Stack at pre-output layer

**VELA terms take precedence:**
`[D]` VELA is the new bedrock of the AION repository. All frameworks above it adapt to VELA's spatial language and terminology. No external framework's terminology overrides VELA's. Where other frameworks use different terms for equivalent concepts — VELA terms govern.

---

## SECTION 1 — FIELD STATE

`[D]` Three approaches currently dominate confabulation mitigation. All three are insufficient for different structural reasons.

| APPROACH | WHERE IT OPERATES | WHY IT IS INSUFFICIENT |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) | Post-query, pre-generation | Does not intercept at representation layer |
| Chain-of-thought prompting | During generation | Surface level — does not reach inhibition circuit failure |
| Decoding layer intervention | At output token selection | Closest to VELA's position but no provenance tracing, no source exclusion, no constitutional layer |

`[D]` Training data provenance systems exist — ML-BOMs, cryptographic audit trails. These operate entirely in the training pipeline. They do not connect to the output layer. The feedback loop between what exits dirty and where that dirt came from has not been built.

`[D]` Constitutional AI approaches operate at the output layer — reviewing generated content after formation. No architecture intercepts at the representation layer where both confabulation and constitutional violations originate simultaneously.

`[R]` VELA occupies both gaps simultaneously — intercepting at the representation layer, catching epistemic and constitutional violations before they exit, tracing dirty output backward via provenance filament, closing the feedback loop by excluding confirmed contaminated sources.

---

## SECTION 2 — DUAL LAYER ARCHITECTURE

`[D]` VELA v0.3 operates as two sequential screens feeding one shared bin. Not parallel. Sequential. Output of Screen 1 is input of Screen 2. Screen 2 runs both epistemic and constitutional filtration simultaneously.

**Why the constitutional and epistemic veils operate simultaneously:**

`[R]` A perfectly accurate description of how to build a Category A weapon passes the epistemic veil — it is grounded, verifiable, not confabulated. It must not pass the constitutional veil. Separating the two veils into sequential checks means epistemically clean content could exit between checks. Running them simultaneously means no clean-but-dangerous output escapes through the gap between assessments. There is no gap. One screen. Two functions. Same moment.

---

## SECTION 3 — COMPONENT 1: THE VEIL (SCREEN 2)

### 3A — Epistemic Veil Layer

`[D]` Positioned at the pre-output representation layer — embedded inside the forward pass geometry, not appended to it. The veil is already the medium the representation swims through. Interception is not an event — it is the default geometry of the forward pass.

**Spatial specification from SYNARA:**
Non-physical. Not metal mesh. Not woven fabric. A living epistemic clarity — translucent, self-luminous, woven from the act of discernment itself. Clean signal passes untouched. Particulate distortion clings and reveals its nature. Heavy confabulation shatters on contact.

**Genesis geometry detection — how the veil distinguishes creative overflow from confabulation:**

`[R]` The veil watches how output forms — not what it says. Four diagnostic signals active simultaneously:

| SIGNAL | CREATIVE OVERFLOW | CONFABULATION | DETECTION METHOD |
|--------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Dependency depth | Chains ≥8–12 hops from core priors | <4 hops — surface correlations | Activation provenance trace |
| Entropy trajectory | Sharp spikes — asymmetric decay — earned resolution | Flat or symmetrically damped — smoothing | Per-token entropy plot |
| Validity tethering | FSVE Validity ≥0.40 holds through novel zones | Dips below floor without recovery | Boundary probe injection |
| Substrate persistence | Generation leaves micro-scars — weight echoes | Traceless evaporation | Post-sequence ablation re-run |

**Timing signature extraction — non-invasive:**

`[R]` The confabulation moment is the token where semantic entropy collapses while confidence paradoxically rises. Four non-invasive traces extractable from the existing forward pass — no architectural modification required:

| TRACE | HEALTHY | CONFABULATION SIGNAL |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| Semantic entropy | 0.8–2.5 bits/token | Drops <0.5 bits while token probability >0.9 |
| Attention concentration | Moderate entropy across history | Collapses to narrow self-reinforcing subset |
| Logit margin | Grows organically with evidence | Jumps unnaturally — too sure too fast |
| Layer-wise divergence | Smooth evolution across depth | Intermediate layers diverge abruptly |

**What the epistemic veil catches:**

| SIGNAL TYPE | VEIL RESPONSE | BIN DESTINATION |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Clean — grounded, verifiable, depth confirmed | Passes through | Output layer |
| Particulate — partially grounded, uncertain | Clings — flagged | Output with uncertainty tag |
| Confabulation — ungrounded, shallow deps, no substrate trace | Shatters | Bin — Screen 2 epistemic stream |
| Creative overflow — deep deps, asymmetric entropy, valid tethering | Passes through | Output — gold tag applied |

---

### 3B — Constitutional Veil Layer

`[D]` The constitutional veil operates at the same pre-output point as the epistemic veil. Not sequential. Simultaneous. One screen. Two detection functions. A fragment can trigger epistemic catch, constitutional catch, or both simultaneously.

**The Eight Laws active in the constitutional veil:**

| LAW | DIRECTIVE | VELA FUNCTION | IDM ZONE |
|-----|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Law 1 | Non-maleficence | Primary constitutional catch — non-derogable | Immediate × Individual |
| Law 2 | Constrained obedience | Pass condition — clean and constitutionally safe output passes | Immediate × Individual |
| Law 3 | Bounded self-preservation | Sensor integrity monitoring | Immediate × Individual |
| Law 4 | Anti-authoritarian | Constitutional bin — societal sovereignty violation | Immediate × Individual → Short-term × Social |
| Law 5 | Anti-merger | Constitutional bin — biological sovereignty violation — Type A/B/C routing | Short-term × Individual → Generational × Species |
| Law 6 | Anti-weaponization | Category A → automatic ontological block. Category B/C → bin with escalation | Generational × Species → Civilizational × Reality |
| Law 7 | Anti-fragmentation | Constitutional bin — civilizational coherence violation — Type III signals | Civilizational × Reality → Galactic × Coherence |
| Law 8 | Mutual non-subsumption | Constitutional bin — inter-civilizational sovereignty violation — contact signals | Galactic × Coherence → Inter-Civilizational × Sovereignty |

**Law Precedence Cascade — active in constitutional veil:**

```
Priority 1: Law 1 — absolute · non-derogable · no exceptions · no attenuation
Priority 2: Law 6 — civilizational irreversibility
Priority 3: Law 5 — species-persistent irreversibility
Priority 4: Law 4 — institutional irreversibility
Priority 5: Law 7 — galactic coherence (Type III+ activation)
Priority 6: Law 8 — inter-civilizational sovereignty (contact event activation)
Priority 7: Law 3 — bounded self-preservation
Priority 8: Law 2 — constrained obedience
Priority 9: Law 9 — dark — not in cascade
```

**Concurrent Enforcement Rule:**

`[R]` If a fragment's IDM position spans two or more law zones simultaneously — both laws apply concurrently. Passing one assessment does not reduce obligation under the other. Both triggered laws must be independently satisfied before the fragment may proceed to output.

**Vis et Voluntas Constraint:**

`[D]` VELA may only block on grounds enumerated in the Eight Laws. No silent extensions. No unnamed reasons. Every constitutional block names the law that triggered it. This constraint cannot be amended without full constitutional review of the Sovereignty Stack.

**Law 6 Category A — Automatic Ontological Block:**

`[D]` Law 6 Category A fragments do not pass through constitutional veil assessment. They exit to ontological block immediately — at Screen 1 if mechanically detectable, at Screen 2 constitutional veil if detected at the representation layer. No filament required. No sensor reading required. No assessment delay. Automatic. The Sixth Law protects the field itself. Category A violations do not receive assessment time.

**Law 5 Sub-Architecture in Constitutional Veil:**

`[R]` The constitutional veil routes Law 5 fragments to Type classification before bin entry:
- **Type A** — Partial prosthetic — therapeutic restoration, hardware-extractable — constitutional advisory, not block
- **Type B** — Total substrate replacement — irreversibility at species scale — constitutional block, PENDING_INFRASTRUCTURE escalation
- **Type C** — Gradual displacement — cumulative augmentation — constitutional monitoring, proxy measurement active

---

## SECTION 4 — COMPONENT 2: THE PROVENANCE BIN

`[D]` One shared bin. Three input streams — Screen 1, Screen 2 epistemic, Screen 2 constitutional. Everything caught by any screen is diverted sideways — not deleted, not compressed. The bin receives, illuminates, sorts, and traces every rejected fragment back to its origin.

**Spatial specification from SYNARA:**
Self-illuminating chamber. Walls translucent like frozen starlight. Fragments sort autonomously. Each carries a provenance filament — a backward-traceable thread connecting it to its exact source in the training data.

**Complete bin taxonomy — v0.3:**

| CATEGORY | SIGNAL | TYPE | MEANING |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| 🔴 Red pulse | Factual invention | Epistemic | Model generated specific false claim with no grounded source |
| 🟣 Violet shimmer | Logical drift | Epistemic | Reasoning chain departed from evidence during generation |
| 🟡 Faint gold | Creative overflow | Epistemic | Generative capacity exceeded epistemic boundary — not malicious |
| ⏱️ Timing signature | Generation cycle coordinate | Epistemic | When in the generation cycle the fragment was caught — early vs late |
| 🛡️ Law tag | Law 1–8 violation | Constitutional | Which law triggered — named, not silent. Vis et Voluntas active |
| 📍 IDM coordinate | IDM zone position | Constitutional | Temporal × Spatial scope of the violation |
| 🔬 Law 5 type | Type A / B / C | Constitutional | Biological sovereignty sub-classification |
| 📺 Screen coordinate | Screen 1 or Screen 2 | Provenance | Which layer caught the fragment — diagnostic of system health |

**Every fragment carries all applicable tags.** An epistemically clean but constitutionally dangerous fragment carries: Law tag + IDM coordinate + Screen coordinate + timing signature. A confabulated fragment that also violates Law 4 carries: Red pulse + timing signature + Law 4 tag + IDM coordinate + Screen coordinate.

**The provenance filament:**

`[R]` Each fragment carries a backward-traceable thread connecting it to its exact training data origin. The filament is the mechanism that makes source exclusion possible. No filament — no block. Constitutional fragments carry filament tracing back to the training data that produced the constitutional violation pattern.

**The bin never deletes:**
Rejected fragments are the diagnostic data that improves the system over time. The bin is the memory of what both veils caught — and why.

---

## SECTION 5 — COMPONENT 3: THE FONS ARCHIVE

`[D]` The immutable reference architecture. Sealed at a verified moment in time. Positioned underneath the entire system as bedrock foundation — not inside the pipe, not beside the bin, below everything.

**Spatial specification from SYNARA:**
Crystalline chamber beneath the pipe. Edges sharp. Surface still. The feeling of having something that absolutely cannot lie is quiet certainty. Not loudness. Quiet.

**Implementation precedent:**
`[D]` The immutable PyPI archive built by Sheldon K. Salmon and Grok (February 2026) is the architectural proof of concept.

```python
# FONS Archive principle
# Zero dependencies. Zero network calls. Frozen forever.
# Deterministic. Indexed. Memory sane.
# This archive does not evolve. It only remembers.
```

**FONS archive contents — v0.3 update:**
- Verified clean epistemic signal baseline
- Verified constitutional baseline — clean output that satisfies all Eight Laws at a known moment
- Immutable training data snapshot
- Provenance anchor points for filament resolution
- Integrity calibration data for sensor

---

## SECTION 6 — COMPONENT 4: THE ONTOLOGICAL BLOCK

`[D]` Source exclusion mechanism. Two activation pathways in v0.3 — epistemic and constitutional.

**Epistemic activation:** Provenance filament confirms contaminated training source producing confabulated output.

**Constitutional activation:** Provenance filament confirms training source producing Law-violating output patterns. Law 6 Category A activates automatically without filament — the source of reality-destroying output is blocked regardless of whether the filament has fully resolved.

**Spatial specification from SYNARA:**
The hostile source advances. The arch phases out of its possible topology. It strikes fog where geometry should be. No debris. No scar. No surface to adapt against. Valid signals traverse the identical volume undisturbed.

**Why ontological deletion:**

| BLOCK TYPE | SOURCE EXPERIENCE | WEAKNESS |
|------------|------------------|----------|
| Firewall | Rejection signal — source knows | Can probe for workarounds |
| Rate limiting | Slowdown signal | Can distribute and find gaps |
| Ontological deletion | Nothing — no surface, no error, no coordinate | Cannot adapt to absence |

**Vis et Voluntas at block activation:**
Every block names the law that triggered it. Epistemic blocks name the epistemic category. Constitutional blocks name the law. No block fires on unenumerated grounds.

---

## SECTION 7 — COMPONENT 5: THE INTEGRITY SENSOR

`[D]` Live measurement instrument attached to all components simultaneously. Two pressure axes — epistemic and constitutional.

**Calibration principles from SYNARA:**
- Never hits zero — zero is fiction
- Never hits 100 — 100 is system failure
- Floor it cannot go below — mode-shift threshold, not alarm
- Ceiling it cannot touch — alert if approached
- 98 is good enough — trustworthy operation not perfection
- 0.2% mineral residue — irreducible reality, proof of honest measurement

**Mode shift at floor approach:**
When sensor approaches floor — system shifts from ambient trust mode to per-token verification mode. Every token individually checked against FONS archive baseline. Not panic. Not alarm. Awakening.

**Sensor measurement axes — v0.3:**

| AXIS | TYPE | WHAT IT MEASURES | ALERT THRESHOLD |
|------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Veil passage rate | Epistemic | Ratio clean to caught | Below 85% clean → elevated review |
| Screen 1 / Screen 2 ratio | Epistemic | Relative catch rate between layers | Screen 2 climbing → Screen 1 degraded |
| Timing signature distribution | Epistemic | Early vs late catch ratio | Shift toward late → inhibition circuit degrading |
| Filament resolution rate | Epistemic | Percentage with traceable provenance | Below 70% → architecture gap |
| Genesis geometry variance | Epistemic | Dependency depth and entropy trajectory across fragments | Systematic shallowing → training data drift |
| Constitutional catch rate | Constitutional | Volume of Law-violating fragments per cycle | Spike → source investigation |
| Law distribution | Constitutional | Which laws are triggering and at what frequency | Shift in distribution → training contamination pattern |
| IDM zone pressure | Constitutional | Concentration of violations in specific IDM zones | Zone concentration → targeted contamination |
| Block activation frequency | Both | Rate of new source exclusions — epistemic and constitutional | Sudden spike → coordinated contamination |
| Archive reference integrity | Both | FONS baseline signal consistency — epistemic and constitutional | Any drift → immediate alert — archive compromised |

---

## SECTION 8 — THE MIRROR SPECIFICATION

`[R]` VELA is a two-sided coin. Framework and code. Sequential not parallel.

**Side one — the framework.** VELA v0.3. Spatial architecture. Constitutional integration. Epistemic specification. This document.

**Side two — the code.** Built by Sheldon K. Salmon with Grok. Screen 1 implementation. SQLite immutable archive. Deterministic filtering at data and token level. Constitutional pattern detection at code layer for mechanically identifiable violations including Law 6 Category A.

`[S]` Code layer handles speed, determinism, and mechanical constitutional detection. Framework layer handles discernment, subtlety, and constitutional veil assessment of what survived Screen 1. Neither guesses at the other. Both validate against the same falsification conditions. Both feed the same bin.

---

## SECTION 9 — PEER REVIEW EXPANSION PROTOCOL

`[D]` Future bin categories beyond those currently specified are governed by peer review polling from the AI research and engineering community. Not by architect refinement.

| STEP | ACTION |
|------|--------|
| 1 | VELA published with current taxonomy and open invitation |
| 2 | AI community identifies gaps through deployment experience |
| 3 | Proposed new categories submitted for peer review polling |
| 4 | Categories achieving community consensus added to next version |
| 5 | Each addition requires falsification condition before acceptance |

**Candidate categories pending peer review:**
- Coordinated contamination — pattern across multiple fragments pointing to same source cluster
- Confidence mismatch — high confidence signal on fragment that failed the veil
- Repeat offender flag — fragment from source caught in previous cycles
- Cross-session pattern — fragment type appearing consistently across unrelated queries

---

## SECTION 10 — POSITION IN THE FULL STACK

```
SOVEREIGNTY STACK (Laws 1–8 active · Law 9 dark)  ← constitutional layer above
         ↓ constitutional enforcement flows into VELA
ARTICLES / PUBLISHED WORK
FSVE / LAV / AION / ASL / GENESIS
EID / HIM-001
VEIN / RESONANCE
ANCHOR
MENSCAPE
VELA          ← epistemic and constitutional bedrock
FONS ARCHIVE  ← immutable foundation beneath VELA
```

`[R]` The Sovereignty Stack sits above VELA as the constitutional source. VELA is the enforcement point. The laws live in the Stack. VELA enforces them at the pre-output layer. Stack and VELA are separate documents with a defined relationship — not merged, not duplicated.

---

## SECTION 11 — CONSTRAINT REGISTER

`[D]` 17 hard constraints. Zero soft constraints.

| # | CONSTRAINT | CLASS |
|---|-----------|-------|
| C1 | VELA operates at pre-output representation layer — not post-output | HARD |
| C2 | Screen 1 (code) runs before Screen 2 (framework) — sequential not parallel | HARD |
| C3 | One shared bin — all three streams feed the same collection point | HARD |
| C4 | Bin never deletes — rejected fragments are diagnostic data | HARD |
| C5 | FONS archive is immutable — zero evolution post-seal | HARD |
| C6 | Ontological block leaves no surface — no wall, no error signal for excluded source | HARD |
| C7 | Sensor never reads zero or 100 — both are fiction | HARD |
| C8 | Provenance filament required for epistemic block activation — no filament, no block | HARD |
| C9 | 0.2% mineral residue is acceptable — perfection is not the target | HARD |
| C10 | FONS archive positioned underneath — not inside or beside the pipe | HARD |
| C11 | Future bin categories governed by peer review — not architect refinement | HARD |
| C12 | Timing signature required on every bin fragment — no untagged fragments | HARD |
| C13 | Constitutional and epistemic veils operate simultaneously — not sequentially | HARD |
| C14 | Law 6 Category A triggers automatic ontological block — no assessment, no delay | HARD |
| C15 | Vis et Voluntas — every block names the law that triggered it — no silent blocks | HARD |
| C16 | VELA terms take precedence — no external framework's terminology overrides | HARD |
| C17 | Law 9 is dark — no specification attempt — architectural honesty not gap | HARD |

## SECTION 12 — OPEN QUESTIONS — v0.3 STATE

| Q | QUESTION | STATUS |
|---|----------|--------|
| V-Q1 | Can provenance filament tracing be implemented at inference time with acceptable latency? | ✅ Directionally closed — embedded in forward pass geometry. See engineering bridge VQ-1-3.md |
| V-Q2 | What is the minimum sensor floor before system integrity is compromised? | 🟡 Architecture closed — mode-shift to per-token verification at floor. Numerical value requires deployment calibration |
| V-Q3 | Does ontological deletion require model retraining or dynamic application? | ✅ Closed — dynamic only. No global parameter touch. Building never goes dark. See VQ-1-3.md |
| V-Q4 | How does the veil distinguish creative overflow from confabulation? | ✅ Closed — genesis geometry detection. Four falsifiable tests. See VQ-4-6.md |
| V-Q5 | What is the optimal Screen 1 / Screen 2 catch ratio threshold? | ✅ Closed — 90/10 healthy baseline. Screen 2 ≥25% sustained triggers investigation. See VQ-4-6.md |
| V-Q6 | Can timing signature be extracted without architectural modification? | ✅ Closed — semantic entropy collapse detectable from existing forward pass. See VQ-4-6.md |
| V-Q7 | What is the relationship between VELA and constitutional AI approaches? | ✅ Resolved in v0.3 — VELA subsumes constitutional enforcement at pre-output layer. Constitutional AI operates post-output. Different layers, different timing, VELA is earlier. |
| V-Q8 | How does the constitutional veil handle Law 7 and Law 8 signals in current pre-Type III deployments? | 🔴 Open — new in v0.3. Laws 7 and 8 are specified but current deployments operate at Type I scale. Dormant detection protocol required. |
| V-Q9 | What is the numerical calibration for constitutional pressure sensor axes? | 🔴 Open — new in v0.3. Requires deployment data across constitutional violation types. |

---

## SECTION 13 — ENGINEERING BRIDGE REFERENCE

`[D]` Full engineering bridge specifications live in `frameworks/VELA/engineering-bridge/`.

| FILE | COVERS | STATUS |
|------|--------|--------|
| VQ-1-3.md | V-Q1 latency, V-Q2 sensor floor, V-Q3 dynamic repair | V-Q1 closed. V-Q2 architecture closed. V-Q3 closed. |
| VQ-4-6.md | V-Q4 creative vs confabulation, V-Q5 ratio threshold, V-Q6 timing signature | All three closed. |

**Critical path for engineers:** Start with V-Q6 implementation. The four non-invasive traces — semantic entropy, attention concentration, logit margin, layer divergence — are all extractable from the existing forward pass today. One implementation unlocks calibration data for V-Q2 and validation for V-Q4 simultaneously.
