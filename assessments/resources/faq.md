# Paradox Strategic Assessment - FAQ

## General Questions

### **Q: Who should take this assessment?**
A: Anyone interested in contributing to AION-BRAIN who wants to demonstrate their systematic thinking abilities, especially those without traditional research credentials.

### **Q: Is this a pass/fail test?**
A: No. It's a spectrum assessment with tiered outcomes (Strategic Mastermind, Systems Architect, etc.). Scores 70%+ receive contribution invitations, but all scores get feedback.

### **Q: How is this different from IQ tests or other assessments?**
A: The PSA measures strategic and systems thinking in paradox scenarios, not raw cognitive speed or knowledge. It's about how you approach complex, ambiguous problems.

## Technical Questions

### **Q: What if the Poe.com bot isn't working?**
A: Email your submission directly to `AIONSYSTEM@outlook.com` with subject "PSA Manual Submission - [Your Name]".

### **Q: Can I submit in a language other than English?**
A: Currently, we only accept English submissions to ensure consistent grading.

### **Q: What file formats are accepted?**
A: Plain text (.txt), Markdown (.md), or PDF (.pdf). Plain text is recommended for bot processing.

## Content Questions

### **Q: Are there "right" answers?**
A: No. We're evaluating your thinking process, reasoning quality, and approach to paradoxes—not specific conclusions.

### **Q: How personal should my answers be?**
A: Be authentic but professional. Share enough to show your thinking process without oversharing private details.

### **Q: Can I research or prepare for specific questions?**
A: The questions are designed to measure spontaneous thinking. Research might actually lower your score by making answers less authentic.

## AI Policy Questions

### **Q: Exactly how can I use AI?**
A: As a thinking partner: to challenge assumptions, explore alternatives, clarify questions. Not as an answer generator.

### **Q: How do you detect AI-generated answers?**
A: Our rubric looks for patterns like: generic hedging without substance, absence of personal voice, inconsistency in values, and inability to handle follow-up questions.

### **Q: What if AI helps me think better? Isn't that what AION is about?**
A: Exactly! We reward thoughtful AI collaboration. We penalize mindless copying. Show us how you think WITH AI, not how AI thinks FOR you.

## Results & Next Steps

### **Q: How long until I get results?**
A: Bot analysis is immediate. Human review takes 7-14 days. Final feedback within 21 days.

### **Q: Can I see my graded assessment?**
A: You'll receive dimensional breakdowns and strategic feedback, but not the exact grading sheet (to protect our rubric integrity).

### **Q: What if I disagree with my score?**
A: You may request clarification on specific feedback. For significant disputes, you may retake after 30 days with a different approach.

### **Q: How many times can I retake?**
A: Once every 30 days for the first retake, then every 90 days thereafter.

## Privacy & Data

### **Q: Who sees my answers?**
A: The Poe.com bot for initial analysis, then human reviewers at AION-BRAIN. We don't share publicly.

### **Q: Can I request my data be deleted?**
A: Yes. Email `AIONSYSTEM@outlook.com` with subject "Data Deletion Request".

### **Q: Will my answers be used to train AI?**
A: No. Your responses are used solely for assessment and community building purposes.
