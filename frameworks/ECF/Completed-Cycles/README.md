## What This Folder Contains

Each file in this folder is a completed 5-entry validation cycle for ECF v0.5, run against the Framework Calibration Log (FCL Master v2.6) protocol. All predictions were timestamped before execution. All outcomes are logged immutably. All negative results are present.

Together these 6 files constitute the complete empirical record that moved ECF v0.5 from M-SPECULATIVE to **M-STRONG** — the first framework in the AION-BRAIN stack to achieve this level.

## Reading Order

Read cycle files in sequence (1 → 6) to follow the discovery arc. The most commercially significant findings appear in Cycles 4 and 6: JARGON_VOID (the mechanism behind AI governance failures in corporate communication) and WORLDVIEW_CONTAMINATION (the mechanism behind institutional gatekeeping that token-level scanning cannot detect).

## What Comes Next

These cycles belong to **ECF v0.5**. When ECF v0.6 begins its validation arc, its cycle files will be created in a new folder. v0.6 starts at M-SPECULATIVE (0 FCL entries) and does not inherit M-STRONG from v0.5.

Summaries for each cycle are available in `../ECF-Summaries/`.
The Moon-View Instrument generated from this 30-entry arc is at `/outputs/ECF-One-Page-Moon-View.md`.
