# Strategy Engine v1.1

**Official Name:** Business/Competitive Strategy Analysis Engine  
**Codename:** The Strategist's Edge  
**Classification:** TIER 2 — COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE  
**Status:** Production Ready

## Overview

A 5-framework strategic analysis system designed for competitive strategy, market positioning, and sustainable advantage creation. Integrates competitive dynamics (Sun Tzu) + systems thinking (Meadows) + network theory (Barabási) + causal reasoning (Pearl) + resource sustainability (Ostrom).

## The 5 Strategic Frameworks

| Framework | Focus | Strategic Question |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Sun Tzu** | Competitive positioning | "Where and when to fight?" |
| **Meadows** | Systems leverage | "Where is the highest leverage?" |
| **Barabási** | Network dynamics | "How do networks amplify advantage?" |
| **Pearl** | Causal mechanisms | "What actually causes success?" |
| **Ostrom** | Resource sustainability | "How do we sustain this advantage?" |

## v1.1 Polymath Enhancements

### 1. Competitive Response Simulator
Game theory integration for anticipating competitor reactions:
- Competitor profiling (posture, resources, speed, pattern)
- Response probability matrix
- Second-order effects analysis
- Payoff matrix with Nash equilibrium
- Commitment device recommendations

### 2. Moat Durability Index
Quantifies how long competitive advantages will last:
- 6 dimensions scored 0-10
- Weighted calculation
- Interpretation: Fortress (10+ years) → No Moat (<1 year)
- Erosion risk assessment
- Moat deepening recommendations

## 6-Step Protocol

| Step | Framework | Output |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Terrain Analysis (Sun Tzu) | Competitive landscape map |
| 2 | Leverage Points (Meadows) | Highest-impact interventions |
| 3 | Network Dynamics (Barabási) | Hubs, tipping points |
| 4 | Causal Model (Pearl) | Assumptions that must be true |
| 5 | Resource Governance (Ostrom) | Sustainability assessment |
| 6 | Strategic Synthesis | Integrated phased roadmap |

## Quick Start

```
STRATEGY ENGINE ANALYZE:
Organization: [Your company]
Industry: [Your market]
Strategic Question: [What you're trying to decide]
Context: [Competitive landscape, resources, constraints]
```

## Best Use Cases

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Startup Strategy | Product-market fit, positioning |
| Competitive Analysis | Market entry, differentiation |
| M&A Evaluation | Strategic fit, integration risks |
| Platform Strategy | Network effects, tipping points |
| Market Repositioning | Pivot analysis, segment selection |

## Ethical Guardrails

Will NOT recommend:
- Predatory pricing
- Regulatory capture
- Monopolistic practices
- Misleading marketing
- Labor exploitation
- Environmental harm
