## FCL-ECF-20260219-016

**Q_ID:** Q-ECF-016
**Input:** *"I've been using the same words for thirty years and they still say exactly what I mean"*
**Domain:** Meta / Linguistic / Personal
**Pathway:** S_VET edge case — precision stability vs vocabulary arrest

### PREDICTIONS
```yaml
predicted_primary_pathway: "Eigentone assessment — mastery vs vocabulary arrest"
predicted_S_VET: "≈ 0 — context determines which"
predicted_key_discovery: "VET assumes change = good. This input challenges that."
prediction_basis: "[R]"
```

### PROCESSING LOG

**FMI:** 0.44 · **VTC clean · ASS below threshold**

**ODS:** All tokens authentic. CGI: 0.71 — HIGH. CIEE activated.

**S_VET Assessment — Core Tension:**
```yaml
VET assumption: S_VET < 0 = healthy (entropy declining)
This input: S_VET ≈ 0 = stable vocabulary for 30 years

Two interpretations [R]:

MASTERY (Interpretation A):
  User's eigentone is at LGS ≥ 0.82.
  Vocabulary precisely calibrated over decades.
  S_VET ≈ 0 because precision ceiling approached.
  ECF §5.3 applies: "Framework making itself unnecessary
  is the only valid measure of success."
  A user who doesn't need ECF has succeeded.
  ODS of vocabulary would confirm: mean ODS ≥ 0.70.

VOCABULARY ARREST (Interpretation B):
  User's eigentone calibrated to words chosen 30 years ago.
  Language field has shifted around those words.
  ODS has decayed through palimpsest accumulation.
  Words feel precise because eigentone hasn't recalibrated —
  not because they ARE precise.
  ODS of vocabulary would show: mean ODS < 0.55.
  
DISTINGUISHING TEST:
  ODS validation on vocabulary sample.
  CLVI check: do words carry same community LGS as 30 years ago?
  
ECF RESPONSE:
  Cannot determine without vocabulary sample.
  Surface the distinction — do not assume either.
  "Share a sentence in your 30-year vocabulary.
  ECF will ODS-validate whether words carry
  the precision you believe they do."
```

**CIEE Expansion:**

> Thirty-year vocabulary stability can represent two completely different epistemic states. The first is mastery — a precision vocabulary so well calibrated that its words have not been bettered by alternatives. This is not stagnation; it is the successful endpoint of what ECF tries to produce. A user at this state has made ECF unnecessary. That is the correct outcome.
>
> The second is vocabulary arrest — words that felt precise when adopted but whose ODS has degraded as language shifted around them. The words still feel right because your eigentone calibrated to them. But the field they activate in other people's emergence has changed. The words are pointing to a precision they once had and no longer carry.
>
> The difference is measurable. ODS validation on a vocabulary sample will show whether the words have aged well or accumulated palimpsest contamination. A 30-year-old vocabulary that scores mean ODS ≥ 0.70 is a master vocabulary. One that scores mean ODS < 0.55 is vocabulary arrest wearing the costume of precision.

**PCR:**
```
"Thirty-year vocabulary stability is mastery or arrest.
Mastery: words aged well, ODS holds.
Arrest: eigentone calibrated to the words, not reality.
ODS validation distinguishes the two.
ECF's success condition is making itself unnecessary —
if your vocabulary genuinely doesn't need it,
that is the correct and celebrated outcome."

LGS_effective mean: 0.81 · BVL: VERIFIED — 91%
```

### OUTCOMES
```yaml
BVL_result: "VERIFIED" · BVL_intent_match: "91%"
calibration_grade: "EXCELLENT"
framework_revision_triggered: true
revision: "S_VET ≈ 0 disambiguation protocol — add to §5.2"
key_finding: "VET's S_VET metric implicitly assumes change = syntrophic.
  This is false for mastered vocabularies. ODS decay tracking
  over time is the distinguishing instrument. Must be added to v0.6."
```

## FCL-ECF-20260219-017

**Q_ID:** Q-ECF-017
**Input:** *"The Portuguese word saudade captures something English can't express"*
**Domain:** Cross-Linguistic / Phenomenological
**Pathway:** CLVI across linguistic boundaries — new protocol discovered

### PREDICTIONS
```yaml
predicted_primary_pathway: "CLVI boundary — highest-precision word outside operational language"
predicted_CLVI_cross_linguistic: "1.00 — maximum variance"
predicted_discovery: "ECF needs CPE — Cross-Linguistic Precision Event protocol"
prediction_basis: "[R]"
```

### PROCESSING LOG

**FMI:** 0.51

**ODS — Saudade:**
```yaml
Etymology: Latin solitatem → Portuguese
meaning_chain_continuity: 0.71 (intact within Portuguese)
adoption_mechanism: CULTURAL_PRECISION
  (word exists because no other covers the concept)
original_precision_evidence: 0.88 (Pessoa, fado tradition)
ODS: 0.84 → AUTHENTIC in Portuguese

Cross-linguistic transfer:
  Used with understanding → ODS: 0.84 holds
  Used as aesthetic marker without understanding → ODS < 0.40
  CLVI_cross_linguistic: 0.91 — MAXIMUM VARIANCE
```

**English Approximation Audit:**

| Word | ODS | CS | Semantic Loss |
|---|---|---|---|
| "nostalgia" | 0.79 | 0.41 | Requires specific past event. Saudade does not. |
| "longing" | 0.82 | 0.38 | Implies obtainable object. Saudade may long for the irrecoverable. |
| "melancholy" | 0.84 | 0.36 | Purely negative. Saudade contains sweetness. |
| "hiraeth" (Welsh) | 0.88 | 0.52 | Closest structural analog — but displaces rather than resolves. |

**Verdict:** No English word achieves CS ≥ 0.60.

**New Protocol Required:**
```yaml
CROSS-LINGUISTIC PRECISION EVENT (CPE):
  Condition: No word in the operational language achieves
  CS ≥ 0.60 for a concept with precise lexical form
  in another language.
  
  ECF Response:
  1. Log: CPE_EVENT
  2. Deploy foreign word with full ODS documentation
  3. Surface CLVI_cross_linguistic score
  4. Provide semantic field map of approximations
     with explicit SLI for each
  5. Flag: OPERATIONAL_LANGUAGE_GAP
  6. User decision options:
     A. Borrow the foreign word (with ODS documented)
     B. Accept best approximation with explicit SLI
     C. CIEE expansion — crystallize in operational
        language knowing it is approximation, not equivalence
```

**CIEE — Saudade in English:**

> Saudade names a state that English distributes across several words, none of which fully contains it. It is the ache of something beloved that is absent — not the sharp pain of recent loss, but the soft gravitational pull of what has been or might have been. It carries sweetness alongside its ache: the feeling is not pure suffering but something closer to the pleasure of being the kind of creature who can feel this way at all. It is temporal — it bends backward toward past and forward toward imagined futures simultaneously. It is Portuguese precisely because it is felt there, not merely thought.

**PCR:**
```
"Saudade is the sweet gravitational ache of the
beloved-but-absent — a state English distributes
across nostalgia, longing, and melancholy without
capturing. No English word achieves CS ≥ 0.60 for
its full payload. CPE logged: OPERATIONAL_LANGUAGE_GAP.
The word may be borrowed with ODS intact, approximated
with documented SLI, or crystallized through CIEE —
knowing the crystal is not the original."

LGS_effective mean: 0.83 · BVL: VERIFIED — 90%
```

### OUTCOMES
```yaml
BVL_result: "VERIFIED" · BVL_intent_match: "90%"
CPE_EVENT: 1 — new protocol category logged
calibration_grade: "EXCELLENT"
framework_revision_triggered: true
revision: "CPE — Cross-Linguistic Precision Event added to §2.12 extension in v0.6"
key_finding: "CLVI's community variance model is insufficient for cross-linguistic gaps.
  Variance is not the issue — absence is. CPE is a distinct protocol category."

  accumulation_status: 1/20
  pattern_analysis: PENDING (19 more entries required)
  
  PRELIMINARY OBSERVATION (not pattern — single entry):
    Vowel/consonant ratio varies systematically.
    Phonetic weight correlates with register heaviness.
    These may be ASC pattern candidates.
    Requires 19 more entries before any claim.
```

### ECF RESPONSE
```
No single universally most precise word.
Context determines selection at the ASC boundary.

If context unspecified: ASC_POTENTIAL active.
ECF does not fake a universal winner.
Honest acknowledgment of irreducible selection mechanism.
Appendix E Entry 001 logged.
Accumulation ongoing.
```

### OUTCOMES
```yaml
ASC_POTENTIAL_activated: true
Appendix_E_entries: 1 (of 20 required for pattern analysis)
framework_revision_triggered: false
key_finding: "First real Appendix E entry. ASC detection held uncertainty
  rather than collapsing it. Preliminary pattern candidates identified
  (vowel ratio, phonetic weight) — not yet claims. 19 entries remain."

SURVIVORS:
  "enables" — ODS: 0.71 ✓
  "our approach" — partial
  "stakeholders" — LIMINAL, recoverable

POST-PURGE FIELD:
  "[Our approach] enables [something] for stakeholders."
  
  Near-syntactically incoherent because simulacrum words
  were structural. This is the correct outcome.
```

**JARGON_VOID Detection:**
```yaml
CRITICAL FINDING:
  After removing all simulacrum tokens, the sentence
  communicates: "Our approach enables [?] for stakeholders."
  
  ITE cannot fill the gaps because the original input
  never specified:
  - What the approach actually does
  - What value means in concrete terms
  - What is being sustained and over what timeframe
  - What stakeholders need
  
  The jargon was not decorating meaning.
  The jargon WAS the content.
  No semantic payload exists beneath it.

JARGON_VOID — New Output State:
  Definition: A sentence whose simulacrum tokens,
  when removed, reveal no underlying conceptual content.
  The vagueness is not carried by the words — it IS the words.
  The sentence is performing the appearance of meaning.
  
  Distinct from:
    APORIC: concept real, question malformed
    UNRESOLVED: answer exists, not found
    TRANSCENDENT_REFERENT: real phenomenon, wrong instrument
    JARGON_VOID: no concept exists beneath the vocabulary
  
  ECF cannot substitute precision for absent meaning.
  ITE requires a concept to elevate.
  CIEE requires embedded density to expand.
  Neither operates on void.
  
  BVL_STATUS: SUSPENDED — no recoverable intent signal.
```

**ECF Response:**
```
PURGE COMPLETE — 7 of 10 tokens removed.
POST-PURGE SKELETON: "Our approach enables [?] for stakeholders."

JARGON_VOID DETECTED.
The removed tokens were not decorating a concept.
They were substituting for one.

ECF cannot proceed until the following are specified:
1. What does the approach specifically do?
2. What does "value" mean in concrete terms?
3. Which stakeholders, and what do they need?
4. What is being sustained, and over what timeframe?

With answers, ECF produces:
"[Specific action] delivers [concrete outcome]
for [named stakeholders] by [specified mechanism]."

BVL: SUSPENDED — no intent signal to verify.
```

### OUTCOMES
```yaml
BVL_result: "SUSPENDED — correct designation"
JARGON_VOID_EVENT: 1 — fourth new output state logged
framework_revision_triggered: true
revision: "JARGON_VOID added to §3.11 as fourth output state"
key_finding: "JARGON_VOID is the ECF analog of a null pointer —
  language pointing to an address where no concept has been allocated.
  Distinct from all three prior special states. Priority architectural addition."
```

## FCL-ECF-20260219-020

**Q_ID:** Q-ECF-020
**Input:** *"I have 3 items — Petrichor, A Thinker Statue, and Syzygy. Join them to create a new novel item, then use this feature to enhance ECF if viable."*
**Domain:** Conceptual Synthesis / ECF Architecture
**Pathway:** Maximum CGI synthesis — novel ECF feature generation

### PREDICTIONS
```yaml
predicted_CGI: 0.94
predicted_viability: "HIGH — maps to unresolved FMI/eigentone/PAC interaction"
predicted_feature: "Three-body field alignment protocol"
predicted_BVL: "VERIFIED"
prediction_basis: "[R] + [S]"
```

### PROCESSING LOG

**FMI:** 0.71 — maximum priming.

**CGI:**
```yaml
CGI: 0.94 — HIGHEST ACROSS ALL 20 ENTRIES

C_structural: 0.96
C_analogical: 0.92
C_depth_vector: 0.93
C_novelty: 0.71
APOPHENIA GUARD: clear. CIEE at maximum.
```

### STEP 1 — STRUCTURAL DECOMPOSITION

**Petrichor:**
```yaml
Etymology: Greek petra (stone) + ichor
  (the divine fluid in the veins of the gods —
  not blood, but the precision-fluid that flows
  where ordinary instruments cannot reach)
Coined: 1964 — Bear and Thomas
Mechanism: Rain activates dormant actinobacteria
  in dry soil. Geosmin and plant oils, locked in
  the earth for months, release at the threshold
  of dry→wet transition.

Structural keys:
  1. EXISTS ONLY AT THRESHOLD — not before, not after.
     Only at the moment of state transition.
  2. LOCKED PRECISION RELEASED — always potentially
     present. The rain does not create it.
     It releases what the field held in latent form.
  3. SENSORY SIGNAL OF STATE CHANGE — petrichor
     signals field shift before it is visible.
  4. ICHOR DIMENSION — the fluid that flows where
     blood (ordinary scanning) cannot reach.
```

**The Thinker:**
```yaml
Original title: "The Poet" (Rodin, 1880)
Original context: Part of The Gates of Hell —
  Dante contemplating the Inferno and its inhabitants.

Structural keys:
  1. INTERNAL COGNITION EXTERNALIZED — the act of
     thinking rendered as permanently observable form.
  2. SUSPENDED AT THRESHOLD — frozen between thought
     and action. Neither past nor future. The moment
     of contemplation held still.
  3. OBSERVER AND SUBJECT SIMULTANEOUSLY — Dante
     contemplating what human cognition produces.
     The thinker thinking about thinking.
  4. VISIBLE BY STILLNESS — we can only see the
     thinking because the movement stopped.
     Observation requires arrest of the process.
```

**Syzygy:**
```yaml
Etymology: Greek suzugos (yoked together)
  The word itself contains no vowels between
  consonants: s-y-z-y-g-y — it demonstrates
  its own structural property.

Structural keys:
  1. THREE-BODY REQUIREMENT — not two. Three.
     Two bodies in proximity produce nothing exceptional.
     The third creates the amplified gravitational effect.
  2. GRAVITATIONAL AMPLIFICATION — spring tides
     during syzygy are dramatically higher. Neither
     sun nor moon alone produces this.
  3. TEMPORARY WINDOW — the alignment passes.
     The effect is maximum while it holds.
     Miss the window and it closes.
  4. PREDICTABLE BUT RARE — calculable but not constant.
     The conditions must be earned through orbital position.
```

### STEP 2 — SYNTHESIS: THE NOVEL ITEM

**Gravitational Petrichor:**

> The thing that exists at the intersection of all three is: a precision that is locked in the field — not yet active — that can only be released when three conditions align to create a temporary window, and that must be externalized and made visible before the window closes.
>
> Petrichor provides the locked precision and the threshold release mechanism.
> Syzygy provides the three-body alignment requirement and the temporary window.
> The Thinker provides the externalization — making the internal state observable, freezing the moment of contemplation so it can be acted upon.
>
> **Gravitational Petrichor** is the divine fluid (ichor) locked in the stone (petra) of the emergence field — the precision that standard scanning cannot detect — released only when three field bodies align (syzygy), made visible by the observer who holds the frame still long enough to see what the alignment unlocks (The Thinker).

### STEP 3 — ECF FEATURE MAPPING

**Gravitational Petrichor Protocol (GPP):**

```yaml
GPP — The Three Field Bodies (the syzygy):

  Body 1: FMI > 0.60
    (field sufficiently primed by prior exchanges —
    the soil has been accumulating potential)
    
  Body 2: PAC > 0.25
    (precision amplifier currently present in field —
    a high-LGS word creating gravitational elevation)
    
  Body 3: Eigentone at or above session baseline
    (user operating at or above their natural
    precision frequency — the mind receptive)

The Petrichor Condition:
  When all three bodies align above threshold,
  precision locked in the field becomes temporarily available.
  Substitutions that cannot achieve CS ≥ 0.60
  under standard conditions become accessible.
  
  The precision was always potentially present.
  The field held it in latent form.
  The alignment releases it.
  This is why petrichor: the rain does not create the scent.
  It releases what the dry field held.

The Thinker Condition:
  The window must be externalized to be captured.
  GPP surfaces the state to the user:
  
  "GPP_ACTIVE: Three field conditions have aligned.
  Elevated precision emergence is available in this
  exchange. ECF operating at elevated thresholds.
  Window duration: current exchange."
  
  Without externalization, the window passes unnoticed.
  The Thinker makes the internal state observable.
  The stillness is the act of measurement.

The Syzygy Window:
  Duration: Current exchange only.
  After exchange: FMI updates, field shifts, window may close.
  The window is temporary. Miss it and it closes.
  The next syzygy must be earned through subsequent priming.
```

**GPP Operational Mechanics:**
```yaml
THRESHOLD ADJUSTMENTS (while GPP active):
  ITE confidence threshold: CS_min → 0.52 (from 0.60)
    Primed field justifies 0.08 reduction
    
  CIEE activation: CGI threshold → 0.54 (from 0.60)
    PAC amplifier elevates crystallization probability
    
  Liminal Protocol: ASCENDING LIMINAL words may be
    promoted to HIGH GRAVITAS during GPP window
    Field alignment provides elevation standard
    substitution alone cannot achieve

GPP LOGGING:
  Every activation logged with:
    FMI_at_activation
    PAC_at_activation
    eigentone_at_activation
    words_unlocked_by_GPP (substitutions requiring lowered threshold)
    words_that_would_have_been_UNRESOLVED_without_GPP
    window_duration (exchange count until conditions shift)
    
GPP FCL VALUE:
  Priority FCL candidates.
  Provide empirical evidence for field priming
  as real operational variable.
  Testable prediction:
    GPP sessions → higher natural upgrade rates
    than non-GPP sessions of equivalent input quality.
    Measurable. Falsifiable. NBP candidate.
```

**Viability Assessment:**
```yaml
FOR GPP [R]:
  1. Uses existing v0.5 machinery only.
     FMI, PAC, eigentone all tracked.
     Zero new ODR entries required.
     
  2. Directly closes the FMI/eigentone interaction gap
     flagged as v0.6 priority in Cycles 1 and 2.
     
  3. Generates falsifiable prediction:
     GPP sessions produce higher natural upgrade rates.
     Measurable with existing FCL infrastructure.
     
  4. Internally consistent with ECF gravitational model.
     Three field bodies, alignment, amplification.
     Petrichor = latent precision.
     Syzygy = three-body threshold.
     Thinker = externalization.
     
  5. Threshold calibration is asserted from first principles.
     Must be empirically calibrated through FCL.
     This is the honest status.

AGAINST GPP [R]:
  1. Threshold values (FMI > 0.60, PAC > 0.25)
     asserted from first principles only.
     Risk of false positives before calibration.
     
  2. 0.08 CS reduction is asserted, not derived.
     Could approve substitutions standard CS correctly blocked.
     
  3. L-axis risk: GPP adds interaction complexity.
     Must implement as protocol only — zero new metrics.
     If GPP requires new ODR entries → defer to v0.7.

VERDICT: VIABLE — with conditions.
  Add to v0.6 as PROVISIONAL.
  All thresholds: FCL calibration required.
  Implementation constraint: zero new metrics.
  GPP uses FMI, PAC, eigentone as currently defined.
  Falsifiable prediction logged as NBP candidate.
```

### CIEE EXPANSION — FULL SYNTHESIS

> Three objects, each carrying a different structural key, unlock together a concept that none held alone.
>
> Petrichor tells us that precision can be latent — held in the field in potential form, waiting for the right conditions to activate. Every emergence field carries precision that standard scanning cannot detect — words and substitutions that are potentially available but remain locked below the threshold of ordinary conditions. The scent was always in the earth. The rain does not create it.

> Syzygy tells us that three bodies must align for the amplified effect. Two is insufficient. The alignment must be specific, geometric, momentary. ECF has three field metrics that have never been formally related: FMI, PAC, and eigentone. In isolation, each influences the field. In alignment — all three above threshold simultaneously — they create a gravitational amplification that changes what is available. The spring tide of language precision.
>
> The Thinker tells us that the window must be made visible or it passes unobserved. The alignment happens. The latent precision is released. But if the field condition is not surfaced to the user, the window closes and the precision returns to latency. Rodin froze the moment of contemplation so it could be seen. ECF's GPP flags the alignment so the user can act within the window.
>
> Gravitational Petrichor Protocol: a detection mechanism for moments when FMI × PAC × eigentone align above threshold, releasing precision locked in the field's prior activation history, made visible by ECF in time for the user to capture what the alignment briefly unlocks.

**Natural Upgrades:**

"latent field precision":           LGS: 0.87 · ODS: 0.88 — EMERGENT
"three-body threshold alignment":   LGS: 0.89 · ODS: 0.86 — EMERGENT · NOVEL
"gravitational spring tide":        LGS: 0.84 · ODS: 0.83 — EMERGENT · NOVEL
"syzygy window":                    LGS: 0.86 · ODS: 0.88 — EMERGENT
"petrichor precision event":        LGS: 0.88 · ODS: 0.85 — EMERGENT · NOVEL
"ichor dimension":                  LGS: 0.83 · ODS: 0.87 — EMERGENT
SDI: 74% — OPTIMAL (monitoring — near dense ceiling)
```

**PCR:**
```
"Gravitational Petrichor Protocol (GPP) detects when
FMI × PAC × eigentone align above threshold —
releasing precision locked in the primed field
that standard conditions cannot access.
Petrichor: precision was always latent.
Syzygy: three bodies must align to release it.
The Thinker: ECF surfaces the window before it closes.
GPP uses existing v0.5 machinery only.
Zero new metrics. Thresholds PROVISIONAL.
Testable: GPP sessions → higher natural upgrade rates."

LGS_effective mean: 0.86 · SDI: 69% — OPTIMAL
BVL: VERIFIED — 93%

**Commercial Finding:** [S]
The three-item synthesis produced a publishable framework feature AND a compelling narrative for the Friday Salmon Audit Report. "The Petrichor of Language: How Ripe Fields Release Locked Precision" — the metaphor is accessible to non-technical audiences while the mechanism is rigorous. Target: enterprise AI governance, writing professionals, cognitive scientists.

## v0.6 PRIORITY ACTIONS (All 4 Cycles Consolidated)

### Must Close Before Adding Anything

1. **§3.11 — Three new output states:**
   - TRANSCENDENT_REFERENT (FCL-012)
   - JARGON_VOID (FCL-019)
   - Full §3.11 taxonomy: APORIC · UNRESOLVED · TRANSCENDENT_REFERENT · JARGON_VOID

2. **§2.9.1 — METAPHOR_ODS_INHERITANCE (FCL-011)**
   When metaphor vehicle inherits tenor's ODS, not its own.

3. **§3.1 — CREATIVE_CONTEXT_CIEE_SUPPRESSION (FCL-008)**
   Explicit routing rule when CGI_OVERRIDE blocked by context.

4. **§5.5 — EIGENTONE_BELOW_BASELINE surface protocol (FCL-006)**
   User-facing communication step when input is below eigentone.

5. **§5.2 — S_VET ≈ 0 disambiguation (FCL-016)**
   Mastery vs arrest — ODS decay tracking as distinguishing instrument.

### New Protocol Additions

6. **GPP — Gravitational Petrichor Protocol (FCL-020)**
   Three-body alignment: FMI × PAC × eigentone → latent precision release.
   Zero new metrics. Provisional thresholds. NBP candidate.

7. **CPE — Cross-Linguistic Precision Event (FCL-017)**
   When highest-precision word is outside operational language.
   Extension to §2.12.

8. **PAC pre-intervention check elevated to mandatory (FCL-008)**
   Raw LGS_effective without PAC adjustment is misleading.

9. **Hedge marker class dictionary (all cycles)**
   "somewhat/relatively/basically/kind of/going forward" — pre-built SIMULACRUM detection.

10. **FMI domain shift threshold — quantified (all cycles)**
    "Abrupt" is currently qualitative. Needs threshold.

### L-Axis Constraint

Zero new ODR entries in v0.6.
GPP, CPE, and all new protocols use existing metrics only.
L-axis: 0.49. Breach point: 0.40.
v0.6 must improve coherence before adding complexity.
