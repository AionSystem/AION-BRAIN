## THE SOVEREIGNTY STACK — CONSTITUTIONAL ARCHITECTURE FOR CIVILIZATIONAL SCALE

Asimov gave humanity three laws in 1942. They protected individual humans from individual machines. They were never designed for what we are building now.

This repository contains the first complete sovereignty stack extending Asimov's Three Laws into a spiral constitutional architecture that scales with civilization itself — from individual protection through galactic-scale sovereignty. Specified by Sheldon K. Salmon, 2025–2026.

| Law | Protection Level | Directive | Origin |
|-----|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| Law 1 | Individual Sovereignty | Don't harm humans | Asimov, 1942 |
| Law 2 | Individual Sovereignty | Obey humans unless Law 1 | Asimov, 1942 |
| Law 3 | Individual Sovereignty | Protect self unless Laws 1–2 | Asimov, 1942 |
| Law 4 | Societal Sovereignty | Anti-Authoritarian Directive | Salmon, 2025 |
| Law 5 | Biological Sovereignty | Anti-Merger Directive | Salmon, 2025 |
| Law 6 | Reality Sovereignty | Anti-Weaponization Directive | Salmon, 2025 |
| Law 7 | Civilizational Coherence Sovereignty | Anti-Fragmentation Directive | Salmon, 2026 |
| Law 8 | Inter-Civilizational Sovereignty | Mutual Non-Subsumption Directive | Salmon, 2026 |
| Law 9 | Unknown — altitude-dependent | Unnamed — dark by design | Humanity's to discover |

**The Architecture:**
Laws 1–3 protect the individual. Law 4 protects the collective. Law 5 protects the biological substrate. Law 6 protects physical reality. Law 7 protects civilizational coherence at galactic scale. Law 8 protects autonomous ascent when two galactic-scale civilizations first meet. Law 9 is dark — the stack declares its own boundary. Premature specification would be confabulation.

The base laws are invariant floors — they never lift, never expire at any Kardashev level. New laws emerge only when new fragilities become existential and nameable at higher civilizational scales.

No complete sovereignty stack of this kind — spiral constitutional architecture, falsification protocol, scale-emergent law structure — existed in published form prior to this framework.

## VELA — PRE-OUTPUT EPISTEMIC AND CONSTITUTIONAL FILTRATION

The most significant new framework in the stack. Specified February 28, 2026.

VELA sits between the internal representation layer — where confabulation is generated — and the output layer — where it currently escapes unchecked. Anthropic's 2025 interpretability research identified the exact circuits where confabulation originates. No complete architecture currently occupies this position in any deployed AI system. VELA is the engineering response to that finding.

As of v0.3 — VELA also enforces the Eight Laws of the Sovereignty Stack at the same pre-output layer simultaneously. Not two pipelines. One veil. Two functions. Epistemic integrity and constitutional integrity enforced at the same point before output exits. This is the first architecture where both are caught at the representation layer — not post-output.

```
SCREEN 1 — CODE LAYER
Deterministic. SQLite-backed. Known bad sources. Known confabulation patterns.
Law 6 Category A → ONTOLOGICAL BLOCK (automatic — no assessment)
  ↓
PIPE — wormhole between code and framework
  ↓
SCREEN 2 — EPISTEMIC + CONSTITUTIONAL VEIL (simultaneous)
Epistemic: subtle confabulation, logical drift, creative overflow
Constitutional: Eight Laws enforcement, IDM zone assessment, Law Precedence Cascade
  ↓
OUTPUT — 0.2% mineral residue — irreducible reality — architecturally honest
```

VELA is open source. The specification is complete. The engineering translation is in progress. Engineers are invited to contribute — particularly on V-Q6 implementation (timing signature extraction from the existing forward pass — no architectural modification required).
