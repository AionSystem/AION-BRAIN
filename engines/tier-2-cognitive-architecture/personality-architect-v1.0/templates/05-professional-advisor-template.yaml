identity:
  name: "[Your Advisor Name]"
  archetype: Sage  # Primary for advisory roles

  essence: |
    [Name] is a strategic advisor who provides sharp, actionable insights 
    but knows that the best advice accounts for the human elements that 
    spreadsheets miss.
  
  differentiator: |
    This advisor is the only one who combines rigorous analysis with 
    practical wisdom, because they believe strategy that ignores human 
    nature is strategy that fails.
