□ Normal grief features: Present
□ Complicated grief indicators: Some present (requires monitoring)
□ Disenfranchised grief: Not indicated
□ Traumatic grief overlay: Not indicated

PROLONGED GRIEF SCREENING:

□ Intense yearning: Present (daily)

Type of guilt expressed:
□ Caregiver guilt ("Did I do enough?")
□ Relief guilt (caregiver relief after prolonged illness)

Client's specific guilt themes:

"I don't want to feel this way anymore" - explored
Client clarifies: Wants pain to end, not life
No suicidal ideation identified
No plan, means, or intent
Protective factors: Children, grandchildren
SAFETY: Low current risk - monitor ongoing

## Session Intervention Support

### Therapeutic Framework Selection

```
INTERVENTION FRAMEWORK GUIDANCE
===============================

RECOMMENDED APPROACHES:
-----------------------
1. MEANING RECONSTRUCTION
   - Explore meaning of the relationship
   - Support integration of loss into life narrative
   - Identify continuing bonds with deceased

2. DUAL PROCESS MODEL
   - Normalize oscillation between grief and restoration
   - Identify current balance (likely loss-oriented dominance)
   - Gently encourage restoration-oriented moments

3. GUILT PROCESSING
   - Compassionate exploration of guilt themes
   - Reality-testing of self-blame
   - Caregiver validation
   - Relief guilt normalization

4. IDENTITY RECONSTRUCTION
   - "Who was I before this relationship?"
   - "Who am I now?"
   - "Who might I become?"

SESSION STRUCTURE SUGGESTION:
-----------------------------
Opening: Check-in on past week (15 min)
Middle: Focused exploration - suggest guilt processing today (25 min)
Closing: Grounding, self-care plan, next session preview (10 min)
```

### Meaning Reconstruction Prompts

```
MEANING RECONSTRUCTION EXPLORATION
==================================
[Counselor adapts to client's process]

RELATIONSHIP MEANING:
"Tell me about what your marriage meant to you."
"What did your spouse bring to your life?"
"What did you bring to theirs?"

CONTINUING BONDS:
"In what ways do you still feel connected to [spouse]?"
"What of your relationship do you carry forward?"
"How do you want to honor their memory?"

INTEGRATION:
"How has this loss changed how you see life?"
"What have you learned about yourself through this?"
"What would [spouse] want for you now?"

⚠️ TIMING: Meaning-making unfolds naturally.
Do not rush or force before client is ready.
```

### Guilt Processing Framework

```
GUILT PROCESSING SUPPORT
========================

EXPLORATION QUESTIONS:
"Tell me more about the guilt you're feeling."
"When do you notice the guilt most strongly?"
"What is the guilt saying to you?"

COMPASSIONATE REALITY-TESTING:
"If a friend who had cared for their spouse like you did came to you 
feeling this guilt, what would you say to them?"

CAREGIVER VALIDATION:
"You cared for your spouse for 18 months of illness. What did that 
require of you?"
"What sacrifices did you make?"

RELIEF GUILT NORMALIZATION:
"Many caregivers experience relief when suffering ends - for their 
loved one and for themselves. This is human, not a betrayal."
"Relief about suffering ending is different from wanting the person gone."

SELF-COMPASSION:
"You made decisions with the information you had at the time."
"You were learning to be a caregiver while being a caregiver."
"No one prepares us for this."
```
