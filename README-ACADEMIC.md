## What This Repository Is

This is the **research workspace** — the laboratory, the sketchpad, the quarry — where the frameworks, ideas, and infrastructure that produced **ANCHOR** and the AI Reliability Snapshot service were conceived, stress-tested, broken, rebuilt, and refined.

Nothing here is a finished product. Everything here is the work that made finished products possible.

If ANCHOR is the house, AION-BRAIN is the quarry, the foundry, and the drafting table where the materials were sourced, shaped, and drawn.

## Validation Status — Live Instrument Readings

### FSVE v3.5-LAV — Certainty Scoring Engine

[![FSVE FCL Entries](https://img.shields.io/badge/FCL_ENTRIES-30_REAL-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=0d1117&logo=databricks)](frameworks/FSVE/)
[![FSVE Convergence](https://img.shields.io/badge/CONVERGENCE-M--STRONG-00b894?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=0d1117)](frameworks/FSVE/)
[![FSVE EV Score](https://img.shields.io/badge/EV_SCORE-0.813_SOUND-00cec9?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=0d1117)](frameworks/FSVE/)
[![FSVE Structural Misses](https://img.shields.io/badge/STRUCTURAL_MISSES-0%2F30-27ae60?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=0d1117)](frameworks/FSVE/)
[![FSVE Cycles](https://img.shields.io/badge/VALIDATION_CYCLES-6%2F6_COMPLETE-2ecc71?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=0d1117)](frameworks/FSVE/)
[![FSVE Mean Delta](https://img.shields.io/badge/MEAN_SCORE_DELTA-%3C_0.03-1dd1a1?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=0d1117)](frameworks/FSVE/)

**Summary:** 30 real-world claims scored across 10 domains and 5 independent predictors (Grok, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Claude). Zero primary structural status misses. Started DEGRADED (EV: 0.525). Ended SOUND (EV: 0.813). The scoring system correctly flagged four inviable systems — including a historical fraud — before deployment, and absorbed a documented field incident without status change. The architecture held.

| Cycle | Predictor | Accuracy |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Formula baseline | 90% |
| 2 | Grok | 60% |
| 3 | ChatGPT | 70% |
| 4 | DeepSeek | 100% |
| 5 | Google Gemini | 100% |
| 6 | Claude (self-prediction) | 90% |

**One falsifiable prediction on record:** If Cycle 7 achieves ≥70% accuracy, FSVE promotes to M-VERY_STRONG.

### LAV v1.5 — Linguistic Audit Vector

[![LAV FCL Entries](https://img.shields.io/badge/FCL_ENTRIES-45_REAL-9b59b6?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=0d1117&logo=databricks)](frameworks/LAV/)

**Summary:** 45 real FCL entries across 8 validation cycles. Six independent AI predictors. Running mean 77.5% — M-VERY-STRONG UNDER REVIEW (threshold: 80%). Two strong cycles restore full status. Cycle 8 accuracy: 80% GOOD. Key finding: *"AI is transforming every industry and creating new opportunities for human flourishing"* scored DDS 0.989 DISCOURSE SUSPENDED — the highest linguistic debt score in FCL history. The AI hype template is structurally insolvent.

| Cycle | Predictor | Accuracy |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Claude | 100% |
| 2 | Gemini | 100% |
| 3 | ChatGPT | 80% |
| 4 | DeepSeek | 100% |
| 5 | Grok | 80% |
| 6 | Copilot | 20% |
| 7 | Grok | 60% |
| 8 | ChatGPT | 80% |

**Restoration path:** 2 cycles at ≥80% restores M-VERY-STRONG. Cycle 9 in design.

### ECF v0.2 — Early Linguistic Precision Work *(Pre-Validation Public Stage)*

[![ECF Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/ECF-v0.2_PUBLIC-636e72?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=0d1117)](frameworks/ECF/)

This repository contains ECF up to v0.2 — the early-stage linguistic precision work that preceded the full framework. ECF v0.2 shows the direction of the methodology: the problem being solved, the initial approach, the first tools developed.

**v0.3 and above are proprietary.** The matured ECF methodology was absorbed into the product stack and is not publicly available. What is here is enough to understand where the work began. It is not enough to replicate where it went.

### Proprietary Stack — ANCHOR Foundation

MENSCAPE, DERU, the full LAV v1.5, and ANCHOR v1.0 are proprietary. They are mentioned here because they exist, because they emerged from this workspace, and because understanding the public research without knowing where it went would be an incomplete picture.

They will not be in this repository. The methodology that produced them took years to develop and will not be open-sourced. If you are attempting to reverse-engineer the ANCHOR stack from the public frameworks above: you have years of work ahead of you and you are starting from an early stage of a journey that has moved considerably further.

## Why This Workspace Exists — The Full Journey

AI certainty is not a problem that yields to the first framework you build. Every framework here represented a genuine attempt to solve a real problem — and every limitation that framework revealed sent the work deeper.

The sequence:

**FSVE → AION → ASL → GENESIS** — each addressed real problems in AI certainty scoring and deployment safety. But each rested on assumptions about language, meaning, and epistemic foundations that hadn't been examined. The frameworks were sophisticated. The soil they were planted in hadn't been tested.

That forced the work deeper.

**ECF → LAV** — the linguistic precision layer — emerged from recognizing that the vocabulary used to describe AI certainty was itself compromised. *Confidence.* *Validity.* *Trust.* These words were doing active damage to the precision of the frameworks above them. You cannot build a certainty architecture on uncertain language.

That forced the work deeper still.

**DERU** — the pre-linguistic invariant substrate — emerged from recognizing that even linguistic roots needed grounding. What makes a concept genuinely durable across civilizations, across millennia, across substrates we cannot currently imagine?

**MENSCAPE** — the pre-germination layer — is where the work arrived at bedrock. The workshop itself. The operating conditions that make seed-level thinking possible at all.

From bedrock: **ANCHOR** — the first product built entirely upward from a foundation that has been fully examined.

## The Honest State

### What Is FCL-Validated ✅

| Framework | FCL Entries | Convergence | Key Metric |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **FSVE v3.5-LAV** | 30 real | M-STRONG | EV: 0.813 SOUND · 0 structural misses |
| **LAV v1.5** | 45 real | M-VERY-STRONG UNDER REVIEW | Running mean: 77.5% · Cycle 8: 80% GOOD |
| **FCL Methodology** | 30 ECF entries proven | M-STRONG | Prediction-before-execution protocol validated |

### What Is M-MODERATE (Specified, Not Yet Empirically Validated)

| Framework | Specification | Empirical |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| AION v3.0 | ✅ Complete | 0/5 |
| ASL v2.0 | ✅ Complete | 0/5 |
| GENESIS v1.0 | ✅ Complete | 0/5 |

### What Is Proprietary (Active, Building Toward Validation Through Client Engagements)

| Framework | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| MENSCAPE v1.1 | Active foundation — pre-germination layer |
| DERU v1.4 | Active foundation — pre-linguistic substrate |
| LAV v1.5 (full) | Active — deployed in ANCHOR stack |
| ANCHOR v1.0 | Active — first client engagement generates first FCL entry |

## What Came Out of This Workspace

### AI Reliability Snapshot — Active Service

The first commercial output of this workspace is the **AI Reliability Snapshot** — a structured evaluation of up to 10 real AI outputs a business depends on, returned as a 5–7 page executive report within 48–72 hours.

The frameworks in this repository run in the background of every evaluation. FSVE provides the scoring structure. AION provides the fragility mapping. The client receives the report — not the methodology.

Three founding spots are currently available at no cost.

### ANCHOR — Private Repository

**ANCHOR** (AI Reliability Architecture for Operating Businesses) is the product layer built on this research stack. It is housed in a separate private repository and is not available here.

ANCHOR maps where an AI system's outputs are load-bearing and where reliability degrades. It produces structured deliverables — The Map, The Gray Scope, The Report — for CEOs and founders whose businesses operate on AI systems they have never formally examined.

The product name *ANCHOR* scored CONFIRMED at LDS 0.260 under LAV v1.5 audit. *\*ank-* — the hook that bends into the ground and holds. The geometry is correct.

**The ANCHOR stack from bedrock up:**
```
MENSCAPE v1.1  →  DERU v1.4  →  LAV v1.5  →  ECF  →  FSVE v3.0  →  ANCHOR v1.0
```

## FCL Methodology — Proven Infrastructure

Before building product, the validation methodology itself was proven.

The FCL (Framework Calibration Log) is not speculative infrastructure. It has been used to validate two frameworks to M-STRONG and near-M-VERY-STRONG convergence, using six different AI systems as independent predictors, across 8 validation cycles, with prediction-before-execution logging throughout.

Key properties proven through validation:
- Prediction-before-execution logging is viable and produces calibration improvement
- NBP falsification conditions are operationally meaningful
- External AI predictors can serve as independent validators with measurable accuracy
- Discovery events emerge from rigorous testing rather than theoretical speculation
- Negative results (mismatches, falsifications) are logged with equal prominence

**FCL Master:** v2.7 — available in `/validation/fcl/`

## Open Questions This Workspace Has Not Answered

These are published openly because unanswered questions are data, not weakness:

- Can AION, ASL, and GENESIS be empirically validated to M-STRONG? (0/15 validations complete)
- Does the ANCHOR stack achieve M-STRONG through client engagement FCL cycles? (0 engagements complete)
- Does the FSVE scoring engine achieve M-VERY-STRONG at Cycle 7? (Pending)
- Does LAV restore M-VERY-STRONG convergence in Cycles 9-10? (77.5% → 80% required)

All validation attempts will be logged. Negative results will be published with equal prominence as positive results.
