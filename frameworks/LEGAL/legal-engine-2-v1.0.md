CREATOR: Sheldon K Salmon (Mr. AION)
RELEASE DATE: November 2025
STATUS: PRODUCTION READY

CRITICAL LEGAL DISCLAIMER:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️ THIS ENGINE IS NOT A LAWYER ⚠️

This system identifies legal issues and compliance gaps but:
✗ Does NOT provide legal advice
✗ Does NOT create attorney-client privilege
✗ Does NOT replace consultation with licensed attorney
✗ Does NOT guarantee legal outcomes
✗ Does NOT substitute for professional legal judgment

✓ DOES provide systematic risk identification framework
✓ DOES flag potential compliance gaps early
✓ DOES help prioritize legal review needs
✓ DOES recommend when to consult attorneys

ALWAYS consult licensed attorney for:
• High-stakes decisions (>$50K exposure)
• Regulatory filings or submissions
• Litigation or dispute matters
• Contract execution
• Any situation with criminal liability risk

This engine is a CHECKLIST TOOL, not legal counsel.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 3: CONFLICTS OF LAW ANALYSIS (Multi-Jurisdiction Cases)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IF MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS APPLY:

CONFLICT RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK:

1. CHOICE OF LAW CLAUSE CHECK:
   ├─ Does contract specify governing law?
   ├─ Is choice enforceable? (not unconscionable, not contrary to public policy)
   └─ If valid → Apply chosen jurisdiction's law

2. FEDERAL PREEMPTION:
   ├─ Does federal law preempt state law?
   ├─ Express preemption (statute says so)
   ├─ Implied preemption (conflict with federal scheme)
   └─ Field preemption (federal government occupies entire field)
   
3. MOST SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP TEST (Restatement 2d Conflicts):
   ├─ Where did injury occur?
   ├─ Where did conduct causing injury occur?
   ├─ Where are parties domiciled/incorporated?
   ├─ Where is relationship centered?
   └─ Apply law of jurisdiction with most significant relationship

4. SPECIFIC STATUTORY CHOICE OF LAW:
   ├─ Some statutes specify their own jurisdictional reach
   ├─ Example: GDPR applies to EU data subjects regardless of company location
   ├─ Example: CCPA applies if business meets CA thresholds
   └─ Comply with all statutes that assert jurisdiction

JURISDICTION ANALYSIS REPORT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SITUATION: SaaS company (Delaware corp, headquartered in California) 
selling software to customers nationwide, including data processing.

GEOGRAPHIC JURISDICTIONS IDENTIFIED:

✓ FEDERAL (United States):
  ├─ Trigger: Interstate commerce (selling to customers in multiple states)
  ├─ Applicable Laws:
  │ • FTC Act Section 5 (unfair/deceptive practices)
  │ • CAN-SPAM Act (if sending marketing emails)
  │ • Copyright Act (software licensing)
  │ • Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (security obligations)

✓ CALIFORNIA (Primary State - HQ location):
  ├─ Trigger: Headquarters, employees, physical presence
  ├─ Applicable Laws:
  │ • CCPA/CPRA (data privacy for CA residents)
  │ • California Labor Code (employee rights)
  │ • Unfair Competition Law (Bus. & Prof. Code §17200)
  │ • California Consumer Legal Remedies Act
  └─ Risk Level: VERY HIGH (strict enforcement, private right of action)

✓ DELAWARE (State of Incorporation):
  ├─ Trigger: Corporate formation
  ├─ Applicable Laws:
  │ • Delaware General Corporation Law (corporate governance)
  │ • Fiduciary duties (directors/officers)
  └─ Risk Level: MODERATE (internal governance primarily)

✓ MULTI-STATE (Where customers located):
  ├─ Trigger: Selling to residents of other states
  ├─ Applicable Laws:
  │ • State privacy laws (VA, CO, CT, UT, etc.) - if thresholds met
  │ • State consumer protection laws (50 state variations)
  │ • Sales tax obligations (if economic nexus met)
  └─ Risk Level: HIGH (complex compliance burden)

✓ EUROPEAN UNION (if applicable):
  ├─ Trigger: Processing data of EU residents
  ├─ Applicable Laws:
  │ • GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
  │ • ePrivacy Directive (cookies, electronic communications)
  └─ Risk Level: CRITICAL (if EU users present - heavy fines)

REGULATORY JURISDICTIONS IDENTIFIED:

✓ FTC (Federal Trade Commission):
  ├─ Authority: Unfair/deceptive trade practices
  ├─ Jurisdiction: Privacy policies, data security, advertising claims
  ├─ Enforcement: Civil penalties up to $43,792 per violation
  └─ Risk Level: HIGH

✓ STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL:
  ├─ Authority: State consumer protection laws, state privacy laws
  ├─ Jurisdiction: Conduct affecting residents of their state
  ├─ Enforcement: Injunctions, civil penalties, restitution
  └─ Risk Level: HIGH (50+ enforcers)

  ├─ Authority: State privacy law enforcement
  ├─ Jurisdiction: Businesses meeting state thresholds
  ├─ Enforcement: Fines, corrective action orders
  └─ Risk Level: HIGH (growing enforcement)

CONFLICTS OF LAW RESOLUTION:

ISSUE: Contract with customer in New York contains Delaware choice of law clause

ANALYSIS:
├─ Choice of Law Clause: "This Agreement shall be governed by Delaware law"
├─ Enforceability Check:
│ • Not unconscionable (parties sophisticated, negotiated)
│ • Not contrary to public policy
│ • Delaware has reasonable relationship (state of incorporation)
├─ RESOLUTION: Delaware substantive law applies to contract interpretation
├─ EXCEPTION: NY consumer protection laws may apply regardless (public policy)

ISSUE: CCPA vs. Delaware corporate law

ANALYSIS:
├─ CCPA asserts jurisdiction over CA residents' data
├─ Delaware law governs internal corporate governance
├─ NO CONFLICT: Different subject matters
├─ RESOLUTION: Comply with BOTH (CCPA for privacy, DE law for governance)

ISSUE: Multiple state privacy laws with different requirements

ANALYSIS:
├─ No choice of law clause for privacy (statutory, not contractual)
├─ Each state asserts jurisdiction over its own residents
├─ RESOLUTION: Comply with STRICTEST law for all users (harmonization strategy)
│ • Easier than managing 50 different compliance regimes
│ • CCPA is generally strictest in US
│ • GDPR strictest globally (if EU users present)

ATTORNEY CONSULTATION RECOMMENDED:
⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY: Multi-state compliance strategy
⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY: GDPR applicability assessment (if any EU users)
⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY: Choice of law clause review in customer agreements

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 3: CASE LAW IDENTIFICATION (Common Law & Precedent)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ORACLE LAYER CRITICAL PROTECTION:
⚠️ NO CASE CITATIONS WILL BE GENERATED BY THIS ENGINE ⚠️

This engine identifies DOCTRINES and LEGAL STANDARDS from case law,
but does NOT cite specific cases (high fabrication risk).

FORMAT:
[LEGAL DOCTRINE: Name of doctrine]
├─ Source: Case law (common law development)
├─ Description: [What the doctrine establishes]
├─ Elements/Test: [What must be proven]
└─ [CITE NEEDED: Attorney must research controlling case law in jurisdiction]

EXAMPLES:

[LEGAL DOCTRINE: At-Will Employment Presumption]
├─ Source: Common law (varies by state)
├─ Description: Employment relationship presumed terminable by either party at any time, 
│ with or without cause or notice, absent contract to the contrary
├─ Exceptions (varies by state):
│ • Public policy exception (termination violates public policy)
│ • Implied contract exception (policies/practices create contract)
│ • Implied covenant of good faith exception (some states)
├─ Elements: No written employment contract specifying term or requiring cause for termination
├─ Significance: Limits wrongful termination claims absent statutory violation or exception
├─ Confidence: HIGH (well-established across US)
└─ [CITE NEEDED: Confirm your state's at-will doctrine + exceptions]

[LEGAL DOCTRINE: Reasonable Expectation of Privacy (Fourth Amendment)]
├─ Source: Constitutional law + case law interpretation
├─ Description: Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches where person 
│ has reasonable expectation of privacy
├─ Test (two prongs):
│ • Subjective: Individual exhibited actual expectation of privacy
│ • Objective: Society recognizes expectation as reasonable
├─ Application: Workplace context = generally low expectation in employer-provided equipment
├─ Significance: Limits when employer monitoring constitutes "search"
├─ Confidence: MODERATE (fact-specific application)
└─ [CITE NEEDED: Attorney must research current Fourth Amendment standards in your circuit]

[LEGAL DOCTRINE: Unconscionability (Contract Law)]
├─ Source: Common law + UCC § 2-302 (for goods)
├─ Description: Contract or clause may be unenforceable if unconscionable 
│ (substantively + procedurally unfair)
├─ Two-Prong Test:
│ • Procedural unconscionability: Unfair bargaining process (adhesion, unequal power, 
│ lack of meaningful choice)
│ • Substantive unconscionability: Unfair terms (one-sided, oppressive, shocks conscience)
├─ Requirement: Both prongs must be present (sliding scale - more of one, less of other needed)
├─ Remedies: Void entire contract, sever unconscionable clause, limit clause application
├─ Confidence: HIGH (well-established doctrine)
└─ [CITE NEEDED: Attorney must research your state's unconscionability standards]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 4: INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC STANDARDS & BEST PRACTICES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

While not "law," these standards may be relevant for:
├─ Negligence analysis (breach of duty = falling below industry standard)
├─ Regulatory compliance (agencies may reference in enforcement)
├─ Contract requirements (customer may require certification)
└─ Court expectations (what "reasonable" company would do)

[INDUSTRY STANDARD: PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)]
├─ Type: Industry self-regulation (but contractually mandatory via card networks)
├─ Applicability: Any entity that stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data
├─ Legal Status: Not law, but:
│ • Contractual requirement (merchant agreements with card processors)
│ • FTC may cite violations as "unfair practice" (inadequate security)
│ • State attorneys general may cite in consumer protection enforcement
├─ Key Requirements: (12 requirements, 6 control objectives)
├─ Enforcement: Card networks (fines, loss of ability to process cards)
├─ Confidence: HIGH (if processing credit cards)
└─ [VERIFICATION REQUIRED: Confirm PCI DSS compliance level required (1-4 based on volume)]

[INDUSTRY STANDARD: ISO 27001 (Information Security Management)]
├─ Type: International standard (voluntary certification)
├─ Applicability: Any organization handling sensitive information
├─ Legal Status: Voluntary, but:
│ • May be required by contract (B2B customers, government contracts)
│ • Demonstrates "reasonable" security in negligence analysis
│ • EU GDPR references ISO standards in security requirements
├─ Key Requirements: Information security management system (ISMS), risk assessment, controls
├─ Confidence: MODERATE (depends on contractual requirements)
└─ [VERIFICATION REQUIRED: Check if customers require ISO 27001 certification]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 5: CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS (Private Law)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

If analyzing a contract or contractual relationship:

[CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION: Data Processing Agreement (DPA)]
├─ Source: Contract between parties (customer agreement, vendor agreement)
├─ Legal Basis: Contract law + privacy law requirements (GDPR, CCPA require DPAs)
├─ Key Provisions to Identify:
│ • Permitted uses of data
│ • Security requirements
│ • Sub-processor restrictions
│ • Data retention/deletion obligations
│ • Breach notification timelines
│ • Audit rights
│ • Liability caps/indemnification
├─ Enforcement: Breach of contract remedies + regulatory penalties (if DPA required by statute)
├─ Confidence: HIGH (if contract provided for analysis)
└─ [VERIFICATION REQUIRED: Attorney review of specific contract terms]
