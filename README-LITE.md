## START HERE

This repository is my mind made external.

AION-BRAIN is where I build, break, validate, and archive every framework, method, and system I develop for working with AI. Over the past year I built 60+ frameworks covering epistemic scoring, linguistic precision, sovereignty layers, uncertainty inheritance, and AI output reliability. It is all here — the wins, the failures, the rebuilds, the open questions.

**But here is the thing you need to know if you just arrived:**

I don't sell frameworks. I use them.

Everything in this repository is the kitchen. What I actually deliver to clients is a single clean report — an **AI Reliability Snapshot** — that tells a founder or CEO exactly which AI outputs their business depends on are safe, which need review, and where a human must be in the loop.

The frameworks run in the background. You get the findings.

## What AION-BRAIN Is

This is my research workspace. It will keep growing. Every new framework I build goes here — not as a product, but as the methodology I pull from to deliver better work.

Think of it this way:

```
AION-BRAIN  →  The mind. Always building. Never stops.
     ↓
ANCHOR      →  The product. Simple. Deliverable. Gets paid.
     ↓
AI Reliability Snapshot  →  What the client receives.
                             5–7 pages. 48–72 hours.
```

The sophistication lives here. The simplicity is what I sell.

## If You Want the Service

Three founding organizations are currently receiving a free AI Reliability Snapshot — a structured review of up to 10 real AI outputs with a plain-language executive report returned in 48–72 hours.

**→ Apply here: https://tally.so/r/b5ljko**

No calls. No account. Just a report.

## If You Want to Explore the Research

Choose your path:

| Who you are | Where to go |
|-------------|-------------|
| Researcher or academic | [README-ACADEMIC.md](README-ACADEMIC.md) — full framework specs, FCL validation data, convergence states, open questions |
| Engineer or technical collaborator | [README-TECHNICAL.md](README-TECHNICAL.md) — stack architecture, scoring engines, integration specs |
| Founder, CEO, or potential client | [README-COMMERCIAL.md](README-COMMERCIAL.md) — what the service does, what you receive, how to engage |

## The Honest State in One Paragraph

Two frameworks are FCL-validated to M-STRONG and near-M-VERY-STRONG: FSVE v3.5 (30 real entries, EV 0.813) and LAV v1.5 (45 real entries, 77.5% running mean). Three frameworks are specified but not yet empirically validated: AION v3.0, ASL v2.0, GENESIS v1.0. The proprietary stack — MENSCAPE, DERU, full LAV, ANCHOR — is active and not open-sourced. The first client engagement generates the first ANCHOR FCL entry. That is the next milestone.
