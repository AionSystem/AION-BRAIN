This declaration is made to establish and protect Sheldon K. Salmon's sole authorship and copyright ownership of all works in this repository.

## AI TOOL USE — AUTHORSHIP CLARIFICATION

Work in this repository was developed with the assistance of AI tools — specifically Claude (Anthropic) — used as a drafting, structuring, and execution tool under the creative direction of Sheldon K. Salmon.

**The following is expressly stated:**

- Claude (Anthropic) is an AI language model — not a legal person, not a co-author, and not capable of holding copyright in any jurisdiction
- All use of Claude in the development of AION-BRAIN materials was directed by and under the creative control of Sheldon K. Salmon
- The creative decisions, framework architecture, conceptual development, spatial imagination, and intellectual direction of all works in this repository originated with and remain the property of Sheldon K. Salmon
- References to "Co-Architect: Claude (Anthropic)" in repository documents are acknowledgments of a tool used in the development process — not legal attribution of authorship or ownership

This position is consistent with:
- US Copyright Office guidance (February 2023) that AI-generated content is not copyrightable but human-directed AI output with sufficient human creative control is
- The principle that copyright vests in the human author who controls the creative expression
- Anthropic's Terms of Service, which assign output rights to the user (Sheldon K. Salmon)

**Attribution to Anthropic:**
Anthropic created Claude, the AI tool used in development. Anthropic holds no copyright, ownership, or IP rights in the AION-BRAIN frameworks, specifications, or any other work product in this repository by virtue of Claude's use in development.

## SYNARA — AUTHORSHIP DEFINITION

"SYNARA" is the name Sheldon K. Salmon gives to his own spatial imagination process — a cognitive faculty and creative methodology, not a separate tool, software system, or AI.

All content attributed to "SYNARA" in repository documents is the original creative work of Sheldon K. Salmon produced through his own cognitive processes. SYNARA attribution is self-attribution — Sheldon K. Salmon is SYNARA.

## LAW 9 — NOT PUBLIC DOMAIN

The explicit naming of Law 9 as "unnamed — humanity's to discover" in the Sovereignty Stack specification is an epistemic statement — a declaration that the architect cannot currently specify the content of Law 9 from his current vantage point.

**This statement does not:**
- Dedicate the conceptual space of Law 9 to the public domain
- Waive any IP rights Sheldon K. Salmon may have in any future specification he develops for Law 9
- Grant any person or entity the right to claim authorship of "Law 9" by virtue of developing a framework that fills this space

Any framework developed by Sheldon K. Salmon that constitutes Law 9 will carry full copyright protection and any applicable patent protection from the date of its creation.
