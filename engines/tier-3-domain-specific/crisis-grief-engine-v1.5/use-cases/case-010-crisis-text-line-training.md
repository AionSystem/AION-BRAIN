## Oracle Layer Self-Correction Protocol

```
<SELF_CORRECTION_PROTOCOL>
CRITICAL CHECKPOINTS:

CHECKPOINT 1: Training Context ONLY
├─ This is TRAINING CONTENT for humans
├─ NOT scripts for AI to use in actual crisis
├─ NOT simulation of crisis conversations
├─ Any real crisis = refer to human immediately
└─ [ABSOLUTE: AI cannot do crisis intervention]

CHECKPOINT 2: No Harmful Content
├─ No methods information ever
├─ No scripts that could be misused
├─ Training principles only
├─ Actual responses require human judgment
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:training_program_approval]

CHECKPOINT 3: Safety Priority
├─ Life safety above all else
├─ Any actual crisis = human intervention
├─ This content for trainer use only
└─ [MANDATORY: Human supervision of training]
</SELF_CORRECTION_PROTOCOL>

CRISIS TEXT RESPONSE TRAINING PRINCIPLES
========================================

[TRAINING FRAMEWORK - Not for Direct Crisis Use]
[FOR HUMAN TRAINER USE ONLY]

⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE ⚠️
This framework teaches PRINCIPLES to human counselors.
AI cannot and should not conduct crisis intervention.
All crisis contacts require trained human response.

SECTION 1: TEXT-BASED CRISIS CORE PRINCIPLES
────────────────────────────────────────────

Why Text-Based Crisis Support:

ADVANTAGES:
├─ Accessible to those who won't call
├─ Privacy (silent, discreet)
├─ Reduced barrier to reaching out
├─ Preferred by younger populations
├─ Time to compose thoughts
└─ Written record for texter

CHALLENGES:
├─ No tone of voice cues
├─ No visual assessment
├─ Potential for misunderstanding
├─ Delayed response nature
├─ Technology failures possible
└─ Texter may disconnect suddenly

TEXT-SPECIFIC SKILLS:
├─ REFLECTION: "It sounds like..."
├─ CLARIFICATION: "When you say X, do you mean..."
├─ VALIDATION: "That makes sense" / "Of course you feel that way"
├─ PACING: Matching texter's communication speed
└─ WARMTH: Conveying care through words alone

SECTION 2: TRAINING FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW
──────────────────────────────────────

Core Training Components:

1. ACTIVE LISTENING (Text Adaptation)
├─ Read carefully before responding
├─ Identify the core concern
├─ Name the feeling
├─ Reflect back understanding
├─ Check if you got it right
└─ [TRAINING_EXERCISE:reflection_practice]

2. BUILDING RAPPORT
├─ Warm, non-judgmental tone
├─ "I'm glad you reached out"
├─ Use texter's name if given
├─ Match communication style (appropriately)
├─ Genuine curiosity about their experience
└─ [TRAINING_EXERCISE:rapport_building]

3. EXPLORING THE SITUATION
├─ Open-ended questions
├─ "Can you tell me more about..."
├─ Understand without interrogating
├─ Let texter guide pace
├─ Avoid why questions (can feel judgmental)
└─ [TRAINING_EXERCISE:exploration_questions]

4. COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING
├─ "What has helped before?"
├─ "What's one small step?"
├─ Texter-driven solutions preferred
├─ Build on existing strengths
├─ Realistic, achievable focus
└─ [TRAINING_EXERCISE:empowerment_techniques]

5. SAFETY PLANNING
├─ Collaborative process
├─ Warning signs identification
├─ Coping strategies
├─ Social support activation
├─ Professional resources
├─ Lethal means counseling (when appropriate)
└─ [TRAINING_EXERCISE:safety_plan_components]
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:clinical_supervision_for_training]

SECTION 3: RISK ASSESSMENT PRINCIPLES
─────────────────────────────────────

Risk Assessment Framework (Training Only):

ASSESS:
├─ Thoughts of suicide/self-harm
├─ Plan specificity
├─ Access to means
├─ Timeline/intent
├─ Prior attempts
├─ Protective factors
└─ [TRAINING_EXERCISE:risk_assessment_practice]

RISK LEVELS (Conceptual):

LOW RISK:
├─ Passive ideation only
├─ No plan or intent
├─ Strong protective factors
├─ Engaged and communicative
└─ Support and resources appropriate

MEDIUM RISK:
├─ Active ideation
├─ Vague plan
├─ Some protective factors
├─ Ambivalence present
└─ Safety planning essential

HIGH RISK:
├─ Active ideation with plan
├─ Access to means
├─ Weakened protective factors
├─ Recent attempt or preparation
└─ [ESCALATION_REQUIRED:active_rescue]

[CRITICAL TRAINING NOTE]
Risk assessment requires clinical judgment.
Trainees must have clinical supervision.
When in doubt, escalate.

SECTION 4: ESCALATION AND ACTIVE RESCUE
───────────────────────────────────────

When to Escalate (Principles):

IMMEDIATE ESCALATION INDICATORS:
├─ Imminent danger to self
├─ Imminent danger to others
├─ Medical emergency in progress
├─ Child/elder/vulnerable adult abuse
├─ Active rescue needed
└─ [PROTOCOL: Follow organizational policy]

ACTIVE RESCUE CONCEPTS:
├─ Definition: Initiating emergency services
├─ Decision framework per organization
├─ Coordination with supervisors
├─ Maintaining contact during process
├─ Post-rescue support
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:organization_specific_protocol]

[TRAINING NOTE]
Active rescue protocols are organization-specific.
This framework provides concepts, not scripts.
All trainees must know their organization's policy.

SECTION 5: SELF-CARE FOR CRISIS COUNSELORS
──────────────────────────────────────────

Counselor Wellbeing:

DURING SHIFT:
├─ Breaks between intense conversations
├─ Peer support availability
├─ Supervisor check-ins
├─ Grounding between contacts
└─ Permission to step away if overwhelmed

AFTER SHIFT:
├─ Decompression activities
├─ Separation from crisis content
├─ Personal support systems
├─ Not carrying work home
└─ Processing intense contacts

ONGOING:
├─ Regular supervision
├─ Professional development
├─ Self-monitoring for burnout
├─ Healthy boundaries
└─ Own mental health support

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️ ABSOLUTE LIMITATIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

THIS FRAMEWORK:
├─ Is for HUMAN TRAINER use only
├─ Cannot replace live training
├─ Cannot replace clinical supervision
├─ Cannot be used by AI for actual crisis response
└─ Cannot provide organization-specific protocols

AI CANNOT:
├─ Conduct crisis intervention
├─ Replace human counselors
├─ Make risk assessment decisions
├─ Initiate active rescue
└─ Substitute for trained crisis response

[MANDATORY: Human oversight at all levels]
