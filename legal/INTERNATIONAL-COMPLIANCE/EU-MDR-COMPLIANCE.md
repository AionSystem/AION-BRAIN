## Software as Medical Device (SaMD) Under EU MDR

### EU MDR Software Classification

The EU MDR includes specific classification rules for software:

```
EU MDR SOFTWARE CLASSIFICATION (Rule 11)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Software intended to provide information used for:

DIAGNOSIS OR THERAPY
├─► Life-threatening/Irreversible condition → Class III
├─► Serious deterioration possible → Class IIb
└─► Other situations → Class IIa

MONITORING PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES
├─► Vital parameters, variation may cause danger → Class IIb
└─► Other physiological parameters → Class IIa

ALL OTHER SOFTWARE
└─► Class I (may still require conformity assessment)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
AION-BRAIN: NOT CLASSIFIED — Not a medical device
```

### MDCG Guidance on Software

The Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) provides guidance on software qualification:

**MDCG 2019-11: Guidance on Qualification and Classification of Software**

Key criteria for medical device software:

1. **Intended Purpose** — Must be specifically intended for medical purpose
2. **Patient Benefit** — Must provide benefit to individual patients
3. **Not General Purpose** — Must be more than general wellness or lifestyle

**AION-BRAIN Position:** Research frameworks without intended medical purpose.
