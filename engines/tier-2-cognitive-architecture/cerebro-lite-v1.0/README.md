## Polymath Enhanced Features

### Pattern Confidence Decay Calculator
Tracks how pattern confidence degrades over time:
- Technology trends: 6-month half-life
- Market dynamics: 12-month half-life
- Organizational patterns: 24-month half-life

### Cross-Domain Pattern Bridge
Identifies when patterns from one domain apply to another:
- Biology → Cybersecurity (immune system patterns)
- Physics → Social platforms (network effects)
- Evolution → Product strategy (adaptation patterns)
