## Document Type Detection

Layer 5 automatically detects document context and adjusts precision settings:

| Document Type | Precision | Density Target | Register | Audience |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|----------|----------|
| Appellate Brief | VERY HIGH | 70-80% | Formal, persuasive | Judges, law clerks |
| Trial Motion | HIGH | 65-75% | Formal, adversarial | Trial judge, opposing counsel |
| Client Letter | MODERATE | 45-55% | Professional, explanatory | Client (non-lawyer) |
| Demand Letter | MODERATE-HIGH | 55-65% | Firm, professional | Opposing party, adjuster |
| Contract Draft | VERY HIGH | 75-85% | Formal, precise | Parties, future interpreters |
| Internal Memo | HIGH | 60-70% | Objective, analytical | Supervising attorney |
| Discovery | MODERATE | 50-60% | Neutral, detailed | Opposing counsel, court |

## Vocabulary Transmutation

### Example 1: Contract Law ("unfair")

**Black's Law Dictionary Definition:**
> **unconscionable** — An absence of meaningful choice on the part of one party due to one-sided contract provisions, together with terms which are so oppressive that no reasonable person would make them and no fair and honest person would accept them.

**Transmutation Hierarchy:**

| Level | Text | Acceptability |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Layperson | "This contract is unfair to consumers." | POOR |
| Educated | "This contract is substantively unfair and procedurally one-sided." | ACCEPTABLE |
| Specialist | "This contract is unconscionable under the two-prong test established in Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co., 350 F.2d 445 (D.C. Cir. 1965)." | EXCELLENT |

---

### Example 2: Evidence Law ("unreliable")

**Federal Rules of Evidence Integration:**
> **FRE 702** — Expert testimony must be based on reliable principles and methods reliably applied to the facts.

**Transmutation:**

| Level | Text | Acceptability |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Layperson | "The expert's testimony is unreliable." | POOR |
| Basic Legal | "The expert's methodology is unreliable under Daubert." | ACCEPTABLE |
| Specialist | "The proposed expert testimony fails FRE 702's reliability prong under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993)." | EXCELLENT |

---

## Common Legal Term Substitutions

| Layperson Term | Legal Term of Art | Context |
|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| "unfair contract" | "unconscionable contract" | Contract law |
| "unreliable expert" | "fails Daubert standard" | Evidence |
| "lying witness" | "witness whose credibility is impeached" | Trial |
| "bad evidence" | "inadmissible evidence under FRE [rule]" | Evidence |
| "wrong decision" | "abuse of discretion" / "contrary to law" | Appeals |
| "unfair judge" | "judicial bias" / "appearance of impropriety" | Ethics |
| "fake document" | "forged instrument" / "fraudulent document" | Fraud |
| "broken promise" | "breach of contract" / "breach of covenant" | Contracts |
| "hurt" / "injured" | "suffered damages" / "sustained injury" | Torts |
| "agreed" | "contracted" / "covenanted" / "stipulated" | Contracts |

## Semantic Density Monitoring

**Target Ranges:**

| Context | Optimal Range | Warning Threshold |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Appellate Brief | 70-80% | >85% (reduce) |
| Trial Motion | 65-75% | >80% (reduce) |
| Client Letter | 45-55% | >60% (too technical) |
| Contract | 75-85% | >90% (impenetrable) |

**Density Calculation:**
```
Semantic Density = (Legal terms + Technical concepts) / Total words × 100
```

**Alert Example:**
```
⚠️ SEMANTIC DENSITY ALERT:
Current: 87% (Target: 65-80%, Warning: 85%+)

RECOMMENDATION: Break into shorter sentences to improve readability.

REVISED VERSION: [Suggested rewrite with reduced density]

New Density: 78% (OPTIMAL ✓)
```

## Plain English Mode (Client Communications)

When document type is "Client Letter" or "Client Communication," apply Garner's Legal Writing principles:

### Principles

- Avoid legalese
- Use common words over Latin phrases
- Short sentences (15-25 words target)
- Active voice preferred
- Explain legal concepts accessibly

### Example Transformation

**Legal Brief (78% density):**
```
"Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, Defendant moves for summary judgment
on the grounds that no genuine dispute of material fact exists as to
Plaintiff's prima facie case, and Defendant is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law."
```

**Client Letter (45% density):**
```
"Under court rules, the defendant is asking the judge to dismiss
your case without a trial. They claim there are no factual
disagreements that need to be decided by a jury. If the judge agrees
with them, you would lose the case."
```

### Common Transformations

| Legalese | Plain English |
|----------|---------------|
| "Pursuant to" | "Under" / "According to" |
| "Prior to" | "Before" |
| "Subsequent to" | "After" |
| "In the event that" | "If" |
| "With respect to" | "About" / "Regarding" |
| "Notwithstanding" | "Despite" / "Even though" |
| "Hereinafter" | [Use the actual name] |
| "Aforementioned" | [Use the actual name] |
| "Prima facie case" | "The basic elements you must prove" |
| "Summary judgment" | "A decision without trial" |
