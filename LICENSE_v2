**Copyright © 2025–2026 Sheldon K. Salmon. All rights reserved.**

**Applies to:** All framework specifications, constitutional documents, engineering bridge documents, articles, methodology documents, and written specifications in this repository — including but not limited to VELA, FSVE, LAV, AION, ASL, GENESIS, EID, HIM-001, VEIN, RESONANCE, the Sovereignty Stack, and all associated README files.

**Does not apply to:** Code implementations, software, scripts, and executable files — which are governed by LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md.

**Important distinction:** This license covers the written specifications — the blueprint. Building a new implementation from scratch based on reading the specifications is a use of the specifications governed by this license. Running an existing implementation from this repository commercially is governed by LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md.

## ATTRIBUTION — HOW TO CREDIT THIS WORK

CC BY 4.0 requires attribution. The licensor's preferred attribution format is stated below. Attribution in any reasonable manner that identifies the creator and source satisfies the license — the preferred format is a request, not an additional restriction.

**Preferred citation format:**
```
Salmon, S.K. (2025–2026). [Framework Name].
AION-BRAIN Repository. https://github.com/AionSystem/AION-BRAIN
```

**For academic citation of VELA:**
```
Salmon, S.K. (2026). VELA: Pre-Output Epistemic and Constitutional
Filtration Architecture. AION-BRAIN Repository.
https://github.com/AionSystem/AION-BRAIN
```

**For the Sovereignty Stack — honest attribution requires:**
Laws 1–3 are the work of Isaac Asimov (1942). Laws 4–8 are the work of Sheldon K. Salmon (2025–2026). The Kardashev Scale framework is the work of Nikolai Kardashev (1964). Any use of the Sovereignty Stack should attribute each component accurately. Misattributing Asimov's laws as Salmon's, or Salmon's extensions as Asimov's, is inaccurate attribution regardless of license.
