# Adversarial Considerations

This directory documents how AION-BRAIN may be misused, attacked, or distorted.

Any system deployed in the real world will encounter adversarial incentives.
Ignoring this does not make the system safer.

## Scope

This directory covers:
- Misuse scenarios
- Incentive manipulation
- Reputation gaming
- Prompt exploitation vectors
- Boundary conditions where safeguards fail

## Philosophy

Security through obscurity is not a strategy.
Documented threats are easier to mitigate than imagined ones.

## Boundaries

This project does not attempt to eliminate misuse entirely.
It defines clear limits, warnings, and responsibility boundaries instead.

Adversarial awareness is part of safety, not an optional add-on.
