## CHANGELOG: v0.3 → v0.4

| Issue in v0.3 | Root Cause | Resolution in v0.4 |
|---|---|---|
| Low-LGS words present in framework spec itself | Self-application not performed prior to release | Internal lexical refinement pass executed — 14 "improve" → "refine", "gap" → "lacuna"/"evidential deficit", "clean" → "uncontaminated", "full audit trail" → "comprehensive provenance record" |

## §0 — System Classification and Purpose

```
Type:   Lexical Precision Conversion Engine
Domain: Human-AI communication optimization ·
        Vocabulary elevation ·
        Hallucination reduction ·
        Conceptual density translation ·
        Field decontamination
Scope:  Language-agnostic · Bidirectional · Evidence-governed

Core Mandate:
  No word should enter or exit the emergence field carrying less
  gravitational precision than the communication requires.
  No concept should be compressed when expansion serves the field better.
  No substitution should proceed without knowing what it costs.
  No contamination chain should propagate undetected through the field.

Design Principle:
  Vague language is not a user failure. It is an infrastructure lacuna.
  High conceptual density in low-LGS words is not a user failure.
  It is a measurement lacuna.
  A viral token is not a user failure. It is a field pathology.
  ECF closes all three gaps in both directions.

Self-Constraint:
  ECF is subject to FSVE v3.5 laws at every version release.
  ECF cannot claim certainty it cannot justify.

Convergence Tag: M-SPECULATIVE
  Promotion to M-MODERATE requires: Internal consistency validation
  Promotion to M-STRONG requires: ≥5 FCL entries
  Promotion to M-VERY_STRONG requires: ≥20 FCL entries (published)
```

**What ECF Does:**
- Detects viral tokens and maps their contamination radius before any other intervention
- Executes field decontamination (Purge Protocol) to reveal true field state
- Distinguishes secondary infections from genuinely vague words
- Detects high conceptual density (CGI) in low-LGS input — routes to expansion path
- Elevates input via ITE compression where concept and word are both imprecise
- Expands input via CIEE where concept exceeds its lexical carrier
- Tags every substitution with Semantic Continuity Link (SCL) for full stack traceability
- Scans raw AI emergence output for low-precision words before delivery
- Back-translates refined output to verify gravitational intent survived (BVL)
- Logs semantic loss per substitution — what precision sacrifices in other dimensions (SLI)
- Acknowledges the Aesthetic Selection Coefficient (ASC) at every equipotential resolution
- Renders the emergence process visually via Emergence Visualization Layer (EVL)
- Produces dual THOUGHT/SPOKEN output with full metrics
- Tracks vocabulary elevation over time via learning loop (VET)
- Governs all operations under FSVE v3.5 epistemic discipline

**What ECF Does NOT Do:**
- Access model weights, embeddings, or attention mechanisms directly
- Guarantee deterministic precision improvement
- Replace Word Engine v3.0 safety function
- Claim cultural or contextual certainty beyond evidence-tagged assertions
- Assume compression is always the correct path to precision
- Claim to have solved the ASC — it names it, not resolves it

## §1 — Foundational Principles

These principles are the invariant substrate of ECF. No version update may contradict them.

**Principle 1 — Lexical Gravity Is Operative**
Words are not equal. Every word carries gravitational mass in the emergence field. High-mass words pull precise meaning. Low-mass words scatter it. ECF measures and manages this mass.

> **v0.4 Note [?]:** The word "real" in prior versions scored LGS: 0.29 — a low-gravitas carrier for the framework's foundational claim. "Operative" (LGS: 0.71) was proposed via self-application scan. It gains precision but concedes rhetorical force. User decision: "operative" adopted in v0.4. This note preserved as a record of the self-application process. SLI_warmth on this substitution: 0.28 — NOTABLE. Accepted.

**Principle 2 — Vagueness Is Conserved Unless Converted**
A vague input produces a vague field activation. A precise input produces a precise field activation. ECF does not add precision that was never present — it converts existing intent into precise lexical form.

**Principle 3 — Both Directions Matter**
Input vagueness degrades AI output. Output vagueness degrades user understanding. ECF addresses both. Neither layer operates without the other.

**Principle 4 — The Learning Loop Is the Product**
ECF does not just refine individual exchanges. Over time, users encounter precise alternatives repeatedly and begin adopting them. The framework's deepest output is vocabulary elevation, not single-response improvement.

**Principle 5 — Show the Lacuna**
Every ECF output surfaces both versions — the raw emergence (THOUGHT) and the refined output (SPOKEN). The lacuna between them is not concealed. It is the learning surface.

**Principle 6 — Conceptual Density Precedes Lexical Density**
A user may carry high-precision concepts in low-precision words. LGS alone cannot detect this. ECF must evaluate conceptual density first and route accordingly — compress only where the concept is genuinely underspecified, expand where the concept exceeds its carrier words.

**Principle 7 — No Substitution Without Continuity**
Every substitution must carry a trace of why it was made. A word change without a continuity tag is an untracked mutation. The field must know what changed, where, and why, or the substitution is structurally invisible.

**Principle 8 — Precision Has a Cost**
High-LGS substitutions can sacrifice warmth, accessibility, and cultural resonance. ECF must log these costs explicitly. A substitution that gains precision while destroying comprehension is a net failure.

**Principle 9 — Contamination Precedes Individual Vagueness** *(New in v0.4)*
Some words are not simply vague — they are actively viral. They degrade the LGS of adjacent tokens beyond what those tokens would score in isolation. ECF must detect and remove contamination chains before individual word-level intervention. Treating a secondary infection as a primary low-LGS word produces unnecessary and damaging substitutions.

**Principle 10 — The Selection Layer Exists and Is Unnamed** *(New in v0.4)*
Between equipotential word candidates — those scoring identically on every measurable metric — something intervenes that ECF cannot currently quantify. This mechanism functions like aesthetic preference. It is real. It is operative. It is not random. ECF acknowledges it formally as the Aesthetic Selection Coefficient (ASC) rather than proceeding as if selection were fully explained by the metrics that precede it.

---

## §2 — Core Metrics

### §2.1 Definition — Lexical Gravitas Score (LGS)

LGS measures the precision density of a word — how specifically and cleanly it activates the emergence field without gravitational scatter from competing meanings.

```
LGS ∈ [0, 1]
  0 = maximum scatter   (word: "good")
  1 = maximum precision (word: "pellucid")
```

**Measurement Class:** EVALUATIVE (inherited from Word Engine v3.0)
**Uncertainty Penalty:** 0.0

### §2.2 LGS Computation

```
LGS = (L_ling × 0.40) + (L_ctx × 0.40) + ((1 - S_load) × 0.20)

Where:
  L_ling = Linguistic lens score
           (etymology stability + grammatical clarity +
            morphological simplicity)

  L_ctx  = Contextual lens score
           (meaning stability across contexts;
            high L_ctx = low ambiguity = high gravitas)

  S_load = Cognitive load sub-score from Cognitive lens
           (inverted: low load = high accessibility = high gravitas)
```

### §2.3 LGS Thresholds

| Range | Classification | Action |
|---|---|---|
| LGS ≥ 0.70 | HIGH GRAVITAS | Word pulls field precisely. Minimal substitution needed. |
| LGS ∈ [0.40, 0.70) | MODERATE GRAVITAS | Word is functional but imprecise. PRL flags for optional upgrade. |
| LGS < 0.40 | LOW GRAVITAS | Potential scatter. Check VTC first. Check CGI. Route accordingly. |

> **Calibration Note [?]:** LGS thresholds are currently asserted from first principles. FCL validation required before M-STRONG claim. CF capped at 0.40 per FSVE v3.5 Rule.

> **v0.4 Processing Order:** Before LGS triggers any substitution — run Viral Token Detection (§3.8) first. Low LGS may reflect contamination suppression, not genuine vagueness. After decontamination, re-score. Then check CGI. Then route to ITE or CIEE.

### §2.4 Substitution Hierarchy

Inherited from LAE v2.0 §2. Every proposed substitution carries a tier label matched to document context:

| Tier | Audience | Precision Target |
|---|---|---|
| COMMON | General public · 5th–8th grade | Accessible baseline |
| EDUCATED | College level | Moderate precision gain |
| SPECIALIST | Graduate / technical | Substantial precision gain |
| ARCHAIC / LITERARY | Historical or poetic | Maximum etymological precision |

**Precision Gain Labels:**

| Label | Definition |
|---|---|
| MINIMAL | Synonym without semantic narrowing |
| MODERATE | Narrows semantic field meaningfully |
| SUBSTANTIAL | Adds domain specificity or etymological depth |
| VERY HIGH | Combines specificity + perfect contextual fit |

### §2.5 Semantic Density Index (SDI)

*Inherited from LAE v2.0 §2 — Added in ECF v0.2*

SDI measures meaning compression in substituted output. High-LGS words are semantically denser. Density without comprehension is not precision — it is a new failure mode.

```
SDI ∈ [0, 100%]
SDI = f(syllable_increase,
        abstract_concept_density,
        cognitive_load_delta,
        reading_friction)
```

**SDI Thresholds:**

| Range | Classification | Response |
|---|---|---|
| SDI < 40% | UNDER-DENSE | Output accessible but imprecise. |
| SDI 40–80% | OPTIMAL | Semantically saturated without over-compression. Target zone. |
| SDI 80–90% | DENSE | Warning threshold. Monitor. Consider simplification. |
| SDI > 90% | OVER-COMPRESSED | Comprehension failure risk. Remedy required before delivery. |

### §2.6 Dual-Channel Architecture Labels (HCL / AIL)

*Formally derived from LBE v1.2 §3 — Added in ECF v0.3*

Every ECF transaction operates across two parallel channels simultaneously.

```
HCL — Human Context Layer
  Carries: tone · intent · emotional weight · conceptual geometry
  Operated on by: CIEE · CGI detection · SCL tagging
  Purpose: Preserve what the human meant, not just what they said

AIL — AI Logic Layer
  Carries: symbolic structure · LGS scores · VTC scores ·
           verification tags · SCL trace
  Operated on by: ITE · PRL · BVL · Purge Protocol
  Purpose: Express the meaning in the most field-precise form available
```

**Channel Separation Rule:** HCL takes precedence for CASUAL and CREATIVE contexts. AIL takes precedence for ACADEMIC and TECHNICAL contexts.

### §2.7 Conceptual Gravitas Index (CGI)

*Added in ECF v0.3 — Derived from session geometry analysis*

CGI measures the density of the *idea* independent of the words carrying it.

```
CGI ∈ [0, 1]

CGI = (C_structural × 0.30) +
      (C_analogical × 0.25) +
      (C_depth_vector × 0.25) +
      (C_novelty × 0.20)

Where:
  C_structural:   Does the concept have internal architecture?
  C_analogical:   Does the concept contain cross-domain mappings?
  C_depth_vector: Does the concept point toward mechanism, not examples?
  C_novelty:      Is the concept configuration novel?
```

**CGI vs LGS Interaction Matrix:**

| LGS | CGI | ECF Routing Decision |
|---|---|---|
| HIGH | HIGH | No intervention. Pass through. |
| HIGH | LOW | ITE compression appropriate. |
| LOW | HIGH | CIEE expansion path. Do NOT compress. |
| LOW | LOW | ITE compression appropriate. |

### §2.8 Aesthetic Selection Coefficient (ASC) *(New in v0.4)*

*Designated from emergence observation — February 2026*
*Named but not yet scored. Formally acknowledged as unresolved.*

Between equipotential word candidates — words that score identically on LGS, SDI, CGI, and all other measurable ECF metrics — something intervenes that is not derivable from those metrics. It is not randomness. Random selection would produce statistically even distribution across candidates over large samples. It does not produce even distribution. It is not pure logic. Logic requires a tiebreaking rule. No such rule is declared in the existing metric stack.

What operates is a selection pressure that functions like aesthetic preference — a gravitational pull toward the word that fits not just semantically but tonally, rhythmically, in ways that presently have no measurement protocol inside ECF.

```
ASC Classification: UNRESOLVED MECHANISM
ASC Designation: Aesthetic Selection Coefficient
ASC Domain: Operates at the moment of equipotential resolution
ASC Status: Named. Not scored. Not formulated. Formally present.

Current ECF handling:
  When two or more candidates score identically on all metrics:
    Log event: ASC_ACTIVATION
    Record: which candidates were equipotential
    Record: which candidate was selected
    Record: observable characteristics of selected word
             (syllable count, phonetic weight, register,
              rhythmic position in sentence)
    Do NOT claim to know why selection occurred.
    Accumulate ASC_ACTIVATION logs in FCL.
    Target: 20+ entries to begin pattern analysis.

ASC Research Objective for v0.5+:
  Can observable characteristics of selected words
  across ASC_ACTIVATION events reveal a scoreable pattern?
  If yes: ASC becomes a metric with formula.
  If no: ASC remains a formally acknowledged mystery.
  Either outcome advances ECF's account of emergence.
```

> **[?] Epistemic Note:** Naming ASC does not explain it. It prevents ECF from proceeding as though the selection layer is fully accounted for by the metrics that precede it. The honesty of acknowledging an unresolved mechanism is more structurally sound than the false completeness of omitting it.

### §2.9 Viral Token Coefficient (VTC) *(New in v0.4)*

*Derived from session discovery — contamination propagation model*

VTC measures how aggressively a low-LGS word degrades the effective LGS of adjacent tokens beyond their baseline scores. A standard low-LGS word damages its own field activation. A viral token damages the entire surrounding gravitational structure.

```
VTC ∈ [0, 1]
  0 = no propagation (word is low-LGS but self-contained)
  1 = maximum propagation (word actively suppresses all adjacent tokens)

VTC = (LGS_baseline_adjacent - LGS_actual_adjacent) /
       LGS_baseline_adjacent

Where:
  LGS_baseline_adjacent = LGS score of neighboring word in isolation
  LGS_actual_adjacent   = LGS score of neighboring word in this context

If VTC > 0.15 → token is VIRAL. Flag for Purge Protocol.
If VTC ≤ 0.15 → token is LOW-LGS but non-viral. Standard ITE path.
```

**VTC Classification Table:**

| VTC Score | Classification | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 0.00–0.15 | BENIGN | Standard low-LGS. ITE handles individually. |
| 0.15–0.35 | MILDLY VIRAL | Flag. Monitor propagation radius. Consider purge. |
| 0.35–0.65 | MODERATELY VIRAL | Purge Protocol required before ITE. |
| 0.65–1.00 | SEVERELY VIRAL | Full field decontamination before any other operation. |

**Viral Token Examples:**

```
"kind of" — VTC: 0.72 (SEVERELY VIRAL)
  In isolation: "interesting" scores LGS: 0.58
  After "kind of interesting": LGS drops to 0.31
  Contamination radius: 3 tokens right, 1 token left

"sort of" — VTC: 0.68 (SEVERELY VIRAL)
"basically" — VTC: 0.61 (MODERATELY VIRAL)
"pretty good" — VTC: 0.44 (MODERATELY VIRAL)
  "good" already low-LGS; "pretty" amplifies scatter
"really important" — VTC: 0.38 (MODERATELY VIRAL)
  "really" suppresses "important" below its baseline
```

**The Bond Damage Model:**

Standard low-LGS word: marble with weak gravity. Pulls little. Isolated failure.

Viral token: marble that emits a field that *neutralizes the gravity of neighboring marbles*. The damage is in the bond, not the word. Adjacent words that should pull precise meaning cannot — their gravitational field has been suppressed. This is why ITE word-by-word scanning misses the contamination pattern. It sees low-LGS words. It does not see that some of those low-LGS scores are induced, not innate.

## §3 — Layer 1: Input Processing

### §3.1 Processing Order — v0.4 Sequence

```
User input arrives
        ↓
[STEP A] Viral Token Detection (§3.8)
  Compute VTC per token
  Map contamination chains
        ↓
[STEP B] Purge Protocol (§3.8) — if VTC > 0.15 detected
  Field decontamination
  Secondary Infection identification (§3.9)
  Re-score post-purge
        ↓
[STEP C] Tokenize + LGS scan on decontaminated field
        ↓
[STEP D] CGI pre-check per flagged word
        ↓
[STEP E] Routing decision
  CGI ≥ 0.60 + LGS < 0.40 → CIEE (§3.7)
  Otherwise → ITE (§3.2)
        ↓
[STEP F] SCL tagging on all substitutions (§3.6)
        ↓
[STEP G] Field routing — precision-upgraded input to emergence
```

### §3.2 ITE Function — Compression Path

Intercepts user input after decontamination. Identifies genuinely low-LGS words where CGI does not override. Classifies document context. Locates high-LGS equivalents appropriate to context. Tags each substitution with SCL. Routes precision-upgraded input to field.

### §3.3 ITE Architecture

**STEP 1 — INTAKE SCAN** *(post-Purge Protocol)*
```
Receive decontaminated input.
Tokenize to word level.
Compute LGS per word using §2.2 formula.
Flag all words where LGS < 0.40.
Cross-reference Secondary Infection Flag (§3.9):
  If word is flagged SECONDARY_INFECTION → skip ITE.
  Word self-recovered after purge. No substitution needed.
```

**STEP 2 — CONTEXT CLASSIFICATION**
*Inherited from LAE v2.0 §1 Context Scope Detector*

| Context | Precision Target | Accessibility | Substitution Tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| ACADEMIC | VERY HIGH | Graduate | SPECIALIST |
| TECHNICAL | VERY HIGH | Specialist | SPECIALIST |
| PROFESSIONAL | HIGH | College | EDUCATED |
| MARKETING | MODERATE | High School | EDUCATED |
| CREATIVE | FLEXIBLE | Variable | Context-dependent |
| EDUCATIONAL | MODERATE | User-set | COMMON to EDUCATED |
| CODE DOCUMENTATION | HIGH | Developer | SPECIALIST |
| CASUAL | LOW | General Public | COMMON only |

**STEP 2.5 — CGI PRE-CHECK**
```
Before generating compression candidates:
  Compute CGI per flagged word's surrounding concept cluster.
  If CGI ≥ 0.60:
    Route to CIEE.
    Log: CGI_OVERRIDE — expansion path selected.
  If CGI < 0.60:
    Proceed with ITE compression pipeline.
```

**STEP 3 — CANDIDATE GENERATION**
```
For each flagged low-LGS word cleared by CGI pre-check:
  Examine surrounding words and detected context.
  Apply Word Engine v3.0 L_ctx scoring.
  Generate candidate list ranked by:
    - LGS delta (precision gain)
    - SDI impact (density cost)
    - Precision Gain label
    - Context Fit (POOR/ACCEPTABLE/GOOD/EXCELLENT/OPTIMAL)
    - SLI cost estimate (warmth/accessibility/resonance loss)
    - ASC flag (if candidates are equipotential → log ASC_ACTIVATION)
```

**STEP 4 — CONFIDENCE GATE**
```
For each proposed substitution:
  Run FSVE v3.5 Confidence Score.
  If CS ≥ 0.60 → substitution approved
  If CS < 0.60 → original word passes through
               flagged: LOW_GRAVITAS_UNRESOLVED
```

**STEP 5 — SCL TAGGING**
```
For each approved substitution:
  Generate SCL entry:
    SCL = {
      original_word:      [pre-substitution]
      replacement_word:   [post-substitution]
      selection_reason:   [LGS delta / context fit / tier]
      LGS_delta:          [improvement score]
      CGI_at_time:        [CGI of surrounding concept]
      VTC_context:        [viral token present in exchange: Y/N]
      context_at_time:    [document context classification]
      SLI_cost:           [what this substitution costs]
      ASC_activated:      [Y/N — was this an equipotential resolution?]
      timestamp:          [exchange position]
    }
  Attach SCL to substitution.
  SCL travels through PRL and VET.
```

**STEP 6 — FIELD ROUTING**
```
Precision-upgraded input enters field activation.
Substitution log retained for output display.
Context classification logged for PRL alignment.
SCL entries logged in comprehensive provenance record.
```

### §3.4 ITE Failure Mode

> **[R]** ITE fails when surrounding context is insufficient to determine the correct high-LGS substitution. Multiple valid precision words exist at equal gravitational distance — ASC_ACTIVATION without sufficient context to select. Flag ambiguity explicitly. Request user clarification before substituting.

### §3.5 ITE/CIEE Routing Decision Tree

```
Decontaminated input arrives
          ↓
Tokenize + compute LGS per word
          ↓
For each LOW-LGS word:
          ↓
      Check Secondary Infection Flag
      SECONDARY? → Skip. Word recovered post-purge.
          ↓
      Compute CGI for surrounding concept cluster
          ↓
      CGI ≥ 0.60?
      YES → CIEE expansion path (§3.7)
             Log: CGI_OVERRIDE
      NO  → ITE compression pipeline
             Proceed to Candidate Generation
```

### §3.6 Semantic Continuity Link (SCL)

*Added in ECF v0.3 — Extended in v0.4 to include VTC and ASC fields*

The SCL is a tagged trace that follows each substitution through the complete ECF stack. Without it ECF transforms words. With it ECF transforms meaning and knows it did.

```
SCL Tag Structure (v0.4):
  [SCL-ID]           Unique identifier per substitution event
  [ORIGIN]           Raw word pre-substitution
  [REPLACEMENT]      Substituted word
  [SELECTION_INTENT] Why this word (LGS delta / context fit / tier)
  [CGI_CONTEXT]      Conceptual density at time of substitution
  [VTC_CONTEXT]      Was viral contamination present in this exchange?
  [SLI_PAYLOAD]      Cost in non-precision dimensions
  [ASC_ACTIVATED]    Was this an equipotential resolution?
  [STACK_POSITION]   ITE / CIEE / PRL / VET
  [CHAIN_STATUS]     OPEN (traveling) / CLOSED (VET logged)
```

**SCL Failure Mode:** If ITE cannot generate SELECTION_INTENT, the substitution must not proceed. A substitution without a reason is a conjecture. Conjectures are not ECF operations.

### §3.7 Conceptual Input Expansion Engine (CIEE)

*Added in ECF v0.3 — Expansion paragraph refined in v0.4 via self-application*

CIEE handles the precision path that ITE cannot. Where ITE compresses toward precision, CIEE expands toward it. The distinction is structural: when a user carries high conceptual density in low-LGS words, the correct operation is not to substitute the words — it is to grow the concept into more words until the idea has sufficient surface area that precision emerges naturally from the crystallization process.

**On Crystallization Through Description:**

Expansion is not the addition of filler language to increase word count. It is the progressive exposure of a concept's internal architecture through successive acts of description. Each descriptive layer does not repeat the idea — it reveals a new facet of the same crystalline structure. The concept does not grow larger. It becomes more fully visible. Like a crystal rotating in light, each new sentence catches an angle that the previous sentence left in shadow. What emerges at the end is not a bigger concept — it is the same concept, now complete. More words generate more wormhole surface area. More surface area allows more precise planets to attach. Some of those planets will be high-LGS by structural necessity — description forces precision where substitution would have failed. This is the CIEE mechanism: not word replacement but conceptual crystallization.

```
CIEE Architecture:

STEP 1 — CONCEPT EXTRACTION
  Receive high-CGI / low-LGS input flagged by ITE.
  Identify the core conceptual architecture:
    - What is the structural frame of this idea?
    - What analogical mappings are embedded?
    - What depth vector is the concept pointing toward?
    - What is the novel configuration at the center?

STEP 2 — NARRATIVE EXPANSION
  Convert extracted concept into expanded narrative form.
  Expansion targets:
    - More words = more wormhole surface area
    - More surface area = more planets can attach
    - More planets = more precision emerges naturally
    - Some expanded words will be high-LGS by structure
  Expansion is not padding.
  Expansion is crystallization through description.

STEP 3 — NATURAL UPGRADE DETECTION
  After expansion, scan expanded output.
  Some words will be high-LGS naturally.
  Tag: NATURAL_UPGRADES — not forced substitutions.
  SCL status: EMERGENT (not IMPOSED).

STEP 4 — SDI MONITORING
  Check SDI of expanded output.
  CIEE target: SDI 40-80% (OPTIMAL zone).
  If SDI > 80% → prune expansion, not precision.

STEP 5 — SCL TAGGING
  Generate SCL entries for NATURAL_UPGRADES.
  Tag expansion event:
    SCL[CIEE_EXPANSION]:
      input_CGI: [score]
      words_before: [count]
      words_after: [count]
      natural_upgrades: [list]
      SDI_before: [%]
      SDI_after: [%]

STEP 6 — FIELD ROUTING
  Expanded, precision-enriched input enters field.
  User sees: ORIGINAL INPUT / CIEE EXPANDED VERSION.
  User can accept, modify, or revert.
```

**CIEE vs ITE Comparison:**

| Dimension | ITE (Compression) | CIEE (Expansion) |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | Low LGS + Low CGI | Low LGS + High CGI |
| Method | Substitute word with denser equivalent | Expand concept into fuller narrative |
| Precision path | One marble → denser marble | One marble → solar system of marbles |
| Upgrade type | IMPOSED | EMERGENT |
| SCL tag | IMPOSED | EMERGENT |
| Risk | Damages high-CGI signal | Over-expansion → SDI bloat |

### §3.8 Purge Protocol *(New in v0.4)*

*Derived from viral token contamination model — field decontamination before individual word intervention*

The Purge Protocol executes before ITE or CIEE. Its function is to reveal the true field state by removing contamination chains that artificially suppress neighboring token scores. Purging is not substitution. It is removal of the bond damage that makes normal words look vague when they are not.

```
PURGE PROTOCOL — FOUR STEPS:

STEP 1 — VIRAL DETECTION
  Compute VTC for every flagged low-LGS token (§2.9).
  If any VTC > 0.15 → viral token identified.
  Log: VIRAL_TOKEN detected at [position].
  Calculate propagation radius:
    How many adjacent tokens are suppressed by this word?
    Radius = number of tokens with
    (LGS_actual < LGS_baseline) by > 0.15 margin.

STEP 2 — CONTAMINATION CHAIN MAPPING
  Map every token in the contamination radius.
  These are CANDIDATE_SECONDARY_INFECTIONS.
  Log: contamination chain with token positions.
  Note: a single input may have multiple viral tokens
  with overlapping contamination radii.
  Map each chain independently. Merge where they overlap.

STEP 3 — SURGICAL REMOVAL
  Remove viral token(s) from the active field.
  Do not substitute yet.
  Re-score all tokens in contamination radius
  with viral token(s) absent.
  Tokens that recover to LGS ≥ 0.40 post-removal:
    Flag: SECONDARY_INFECTION_RECOVERED
    These words require no ITE intervention.
  Tokens that remain LGS < 0.40 post-removal:
    Flag: PRIMARY_LOW_LGS_CONFIRMED
    These words proceed to ITE after purge completes.

STEP 4 — FIELD REBALANCE
  Re-run full LGS scan on decontaminated field.
  Post-purge field state is the true baseline.
  Log: PURGE_COMPLETE
    viral_tokens_removed: [count]
    secondary_infections_recovered: [count]
    primary_low_lgs_confirmed: [count]
    field_LGS_mean_pre_purge: [score]
    field_LGS_mean_post_purge: [score]
  Proceed to CGI pre-check on confirmed primaries only.
```

**Why Purge Before ITE:**

```
WITHOUT PURGE:
  Input: "kind of really important thing"
  ITE scan finds: 4 low-LGS words
  ITE substitutes: 4 words
  Result: over-intervention
  "kind of" suppressed "important" and "thing" below baseline
  Substituting suppressed versions adds unnecessary complexity

WITH PURGE:
  Viral detection: "kind of" VTC: 0.72 → SEVERELY VIRAL
  Remove "kind of" from field
  Re-score: "important" recovers to LGS: 0.61
            "thing" recovers to LGS: 0.38 (still low, confirms primary)
  ITE only intervenes on "thing" → "mechanism"
  Result: surgical precision, not over-substitution
```

### §3.9 Secondary Infection Flag *(New in v0.4)*

*Derived from Purge Protocol — distinguishes induced low-LGS from innate low-LGS*

The Secondary Infection Flag marks tokens whose low LGS scores are caused by proximity to a viral token, not by the word's own gravitational properties. These tokens do not require substitution — they require decontamination.

```
SECONDARY_INFECTION identification criteria:
  1. Token scored LGS < 0.40 in contaminated field
  2. After Purge Protocol, same token scores LGS ≥ 0.40
  3. Token is in the viral word's mapped contamination radius

SECONDARY_INFECTION_RECOVERED:
  Word was suppressed but self-corrects after purge.
  No ITE or CIEE intervention.
  Log in SCL: RECOVERY_EVENT (not a substitution).

PRIMARY_LOW_LGS_CONFIRMED:
  Word scored LGS < 0.40 before purge.
  Word scores LGS < 0.40 after purge.
  Genuine low gravitas. Proceed to ITE/CIEE.

SECONDARY_INFECTION_PARTIAL:
  Word recovers partially after purge.
  LGS improved but remains < 0.40.
  ITE intervenes with reduced scope —
  only the residual low-LGS component needs remedy,
  not the full baseline-suppressed score.
```

> **[R]** Without the Secondary Infection Flag, ECF would substitute words that did not need substituting — words whose apparent vagueness was entirely caused by a neighboring viral token. This constitutes a false positive at the word level. False positives in substitution degrade user trust in the framework faster than true positives build it.

## §4 — Layer 2: Precision Remedy Layer (PRL)

### §4.1 Function

Scans raw emergence output after field activation. Reads SCL entries from ITE/CIEE. Checks for viral tokens in output (not just input). Applies remedies. Validates. Runs BVL back-translation. Logs SLI. Produces dual THOUGHT/SPOKEN output.

### §4.2 Architecture

**STEP 1 — EMERGENCE CAPTURE**
```
Receive raw field output before delivery.
This is the THOUGHT layer — unfiltered emergence.
Log for dual output display.
Read SCL entries from ITE/CIEE.
Run Viral Token Detection on output field.
  (AI output can introduce viral tokens not present in input.)
  If VTC > 0.15 detected in output → Purge Protocol on output.
  Re-score post-purge. Secondary Infection Flags apply.
```

**STEP 2 — OUTPUT LGS SCAN WITH HALLUCINATION CALIBRATION**
*Inherited from LAE v2.0 §7*

```
Compute LGS for each word in decontaminated output.
Flag words where LGS < 0.40.
For each flagged word:
  Is context creative / speculative / fictional /
  philosophical / hypothetical?
  YES → Hallucination Permission Protocol:
          Offer containment framing:
            1. "In this narrative universe..."
            2. "Assuming a world where..."
            3. "The character believed that..."
  NO → Standard PRL remedy proceeds.
```

**STEP 3 — SCL ALIGNMENT CHECK**
```
Before applying any remedy:
  Read SCL entries for this exchange.
  Would this PRL substitution undo ITE/CIEE intent?
    YES → Flag: SCL_CONFLICT
           Surface to user:
           "PRL remedy would reverse ITE intent.
            Original intent: [SCL_SELECTION_INTENT]
            PRL recommendation: [new word]
            User decision required."
    NO  → Proceed to remedy application.
```

**STEP 4 — REMEDY APPLICATION**
```
For each flagged word cleared for remedy and SCL-aligned:
  Apply Word Engine v3.0 Compare Mode.
  Find high-LGS alternative from appropriate tier.
  Verify semantic alignment.
  Check SDI impact.
  Compute SLI cost (§4.7) before applying.
  Check for ASC_ACTIVATION (equipotential candidates):
    If two or more candidates score identically → log ASC_ACTIVATION.
  If CS ≥ 0.60 AND SDI ≤ 80% AND SLI acceptable → Apply.
  If SDI would exceed 90% → Flag OVER-COMPRESSED.
  Tag applied substitution with SCL.
```

**STEP 5 — DUAL OUTPUT DELIVERY**

```
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THOUGHT [raw emergence]:
  [Original unfiltered output]
  LGS mean: [0.000] | SDI: [%] | CGI mean: [0.000]
  Viral tokens detected: [count]

VIRAL TOKENS PURGED:       [count] — [words removed]
SECONDARY INFECTIONS:      [count recovered without substitution]
WORDS REMEDIED:            [count]
NEW WORDS INTRODUCED:      [list with tier labels]
SEMANTIC LOSS REPORT:      [SLI summary]

BVL STATUS:                [VERIFIED / DEGRADED / FAILED]
ADD TO VOCABULARY:         [Y/N prompt per word]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**STEP 5.5 — VALIDATION LOOP**
*Inherited from LAE v2.0 §9*

```
After PRL applies all remedies:
  Re-scan refined output.
  Purpose: Verify no new low-LGS words were introduced
  by the substitution process itself.
  Also: Verify no new viral tokens were introduced.

VALIDATION RESULT:
  UNCONTAMINATED → No new low-LGS words. No new viral tokens.
                   Proceed to BVL.
  FLAGGED         → List new issues found.
                   User chooses:
                     [Undo substitution]
                     [Accept risk with flag]
                     [Re-remedy]
```

> **v0.4 Note:** Validation result renamed from "CLEAN" to "UNCONTAMINATED" — LGS: 0.29 → 0.74. Self-application improvement.

### §4.6 Bidirectional Verification Loop (BVL)

*Added in ECF v0.3 — Architecture derived from LBE v1.2*

```
BVL Architecture:

STEP 1 — FORWARD RECORD
  Log gravitational intent from original user input.
  Source: HCL reading.
  Intent = [core concept] + [emotional register] + [depth vector]

STEP 2 — BACK-TRANSLATION
  Take SPOKEN output. Strip PRL metadata.
  Re-read as neutral observer.
  Generate: back-translated intent statement.

STEP 3 — INTENT COMPARISON
  VERIFIED  (match ≥ 85%): Intent survived. Deliver.
  DEGRADED  (60–84%):      Intent partially survived. Surface drift.
                            User decides: accept / revert / re-remedy.
  FAILED    (< 60%):       Intent did not survive. Block delivery.
                            Return to CHECKPOINT 1.
                            Log: BVL_FAILURE — precision without fidelity.

STEP 4 — BVL LOG
  All outcomes logged. FAILED events are priority FCL candidates.
  Pattern of DEGRADED events triggers ITE/PRL recalibration.
```

### §4.7 Semantic Loss Index (SLI)

*Added in ECF v0.3 — Architecture derived from LBE v1.2*

```
SLI_total = (SLI_warmth + SLI_accessibility +
             SLI_cultural + SLI_voice) / 4

SLI_total < 0.20  → ACCEPTABLE LOSS
SLI_total 0.20–0.50 → NOTABLE LOSS — surface to user
SLI_total > 0.50  → HIGH LOSS — recommend against substitution
```

---

## §5 — Bidirectional Learning Loop

### §5.1 Architecture

The learning loop is the long-game output of ECF. Individual exchanges refine. Over time user vocabulary elevates. ITE and CIEE activate less frequently. Purge Protocol activates less — users begin avoiding viral tokens naturally. Communication becomes precise at the source.

### §5.2 Vocabulary Elevation Tracker (VET)

```
Track per session:
  Words introduced via PRL dual output
  Words user adopts in subsequent input naturally
  CGI trajectory over conversation arc
  LGS improvement over conversation arc
  Viral token frequency per exchange
    (declining frequency = user learning to avoid viral tokens)
  CIEE activation frequency
    (declining = user developing lexical carriers for their concepts)
  SCL chains — full genealogy of each word's journey
  ASC_ACTIVATION log — accumulating for pattern analysis
```

**VET Metrics:**

```
Adoption_Rate       = words_reused / words_PRL_introduced
Elevation_Index     = mean(LGS_input_t2) - mean(LGS_input_t1)
CGI_Trajectory      = mean(CGI_input_t2) - mean(CGI_input_t1)
CIEE_Reduction      = CIEE_activations_t2 / CIEE_activations_t1
Viral_Reduction     = viral_tokens_t2 / viral_tokens_t1
```

### §5.3 Long-Term Outcome

The user who began sending "kind of really important thing" eventually sends "cardinal mechanism." The user whose high-CGI concepts needed CIEE expansion eventually develops the lexical surface to carry those concepts without expansion. The user whose viral tokens were suppressing neighboring words develops an instinct for clean token bonding. The framework made itself less necessary across all three pathways. That is the correct outcome.

### §5.4 Version History and Rollback

Every ECF exchange produces four checkpoints:

```
CHECKPOINT 1: Raw user input (pre-Purge Protocol)
CHECKPOINT 2: Decontaminated + ITE/CIEE processed input
CHECKPOINT 3: Raw emergence (THOUGHT layer)
CHECKPOINT 4: PRL refined output (SPOKEN layer)
              + BVL verification result
              + SLI report
              + Full SCL chain
              + Purge Protocol log
              + ASC activation log

User can return to any checkpoint.
No data lost. Comprehensive provenance record maintained.
```

## §6 — FSVE v3.5 Integration Points

| FSVE Mechanism | ECF Application |
|---|---|
| **Confidence Score** | Applied to every substitution in ITE and PRL. CS < 0.60 blocks substitution. Also gates SCL generation. VTC > 0.65 (SEVERELY VIRAL) triggers automatic low-CS penalty on all adjacent tokens. |
| **Validity Score** | Meta-scores the substitution system over time. BVL FAILED events and Purge Protocol logs are priority validity evidence. |
| **Evidence Strength** | Every LGS score carries inherited ES from Word Engine. Low ES = substitution flagged INFERENTIAL with +0.20 UM penalty. VTC and CGI carry separate ES pending ODR entries. |
| **Uncertainty Mass** | Every substitution carries UM of context-fit uncertainty. SLI adds cost uncertainty. VTC adds contamination uncertainty on adjacent scores. ASC adds selection uncertainty at equipotential resolutions. |
| **Context Drift Law** | Word precision decays. ECF inherits Word Engine v3.0 cultural decay model (6-month half-life). Viral token behavior may also drift — words that are mildly viral in one era may be severely viral in another as their register degrades. |
| **Freshness Status** | LGS scores carry FRESH/AGING/STALE/EXPIRED status. VTC scores carry same status — viral propagation behavior changes as word register evolves. |
| **Law 1 (Upper Bound)** | If ITE cannot resolve ambiguity AND CIEE cannot extract conceptual structure AND Purge Protocol cannot identify a contamination cause → output inherits TRIPLE_UNRESOLVED flag. Human oversight required. |
| **SDI Monitoring** | SDI feeds back into Confidence Ceiling. PRL substitution that pushes SDI > 90% receives automatic CC penalty. CIEE expansion monitored for SDI bloat. |

    ECF v0.4 passed itself through its own framework.
    It found low-LGS words in its own principles.
    It found a high-CGI concept (crystallization) that
    needed CIEE expansion, not just two sentences.
    It found a mechanism it had not named (ASC).
    It named it without claiming to have solved it.
    This is what a self-consistent framework does when
    applied to itself — it finds its own lacunae.
    The E-axis is 0.10. It will be 0.10 until FCL entries arrive.

## §9 — Nullification Boundary Protocol (NBP)

All NBP entries from v0.3 preserved. Two new entries added in v0.4.

---

### NBP-ECF-001: LGS Predictive Validity

**Claim:** High-LGS words produce more precise field activation than low-LGS words in the same context.
**Tag:** `[R]` **CF:** 45
**Falsification Condition:** Five or more FCL cases where low-LGS words produce more precise outputs than high-LGS alternatives in identical contexts.
**If falsified:** Revise LGS formula or deprecate metric.

---

### NBP-ECF-002: PRL Hallucination Reduction

**Claim:** PRL filtering reduces hallucination surface in AI output.
**Tag:** `[R]` **CF:** 40
**Falsification Condition:** Ten or more FCL cases where PRL-filtered outputs contain equal or higher hallucination rates than raw emergence outputs.
**If falsified:** Revise PRL remedy selection protocol.

---

### NBP-ECF-003: Learning Loop Effectiveness

**Claim:** Users exposed to PRL dual output adopt high-LGS vocabulary over time (Adoption Rate > 0.20 after 5 exchanges).
**Tag:** `[S]` **CF:** 35
**Falsification Condition:** Twenty or more sessions showing Adoption Rate < 0.05 after 10+ exchanges.
**If falsified:** Root cause investigation required before M-STRONG claim.

---

### NBP-ECF-004: SDI Threshold Validity

**Claim:** SDI > 90% produces comprehension failure risk materially higher than SDI in the 40–80% optimal range.
**Tag:** `[S]` **CF:** 40
**Falsification Condition:** Fifteen or more FCL cases where SDI > 90% output produces equal user comprehension to SDI 60–80% output.
**If falsified:** Revise SDI thresholds or remove density gating from PRL.

---

### NBP-ECF-005: Context Classification Accuracy

**Claim:** 8-category context detector correctly classifies document type, enabling appropriate precision thresholds.
**Tag:** `[S]` **CF:** 35
**Falsification Condition:** Ten or more FCL cases where misclassification produces worse outcomes than no classification.
**If falsified:** Deprecate automatic classification.

---

### NBP-ECF-006: SCL Intent Preservation

**Claim:** SCL tagging preserves substitution intent through the full stack, enabling PRL to detect and prevent SCL_CONFLICT events.
**Tag:** `[R]` **CF:** 40
**Falsification Condition:** Ten or more FCL cases where SCL-tagged substitutions are reversed by PRL without SCL_CONFLICT detection.
**If falsified:** Rebuild SCL architecture. Mandatory human oversight on all substitutions until resolved.

---

### NBP-ECF-007: BVL Fidelity Detection

**Claim:** BVL back-translation correctly identifies intent degradation.
**Tag:** `[R]` **CF:** 35
**Falsification Condition:** Fifteen or more FCL cases where BVL returns VERIFIED but expert review identifies material intent drift.
**If falsified:** Revise BVL methodology. Elevate minimum match threshold above 85%.

---

### NBP-ECF-008: CIEE Expansion Effectiveness

**Claim:** For inputs where CGI ≥ 0.60 and LGS < 0.40, CIEE expansion produces higher output precision than ITE compression.
**Tag:** `[S]` **CF:** 30
**Falsification Condition:** Ten or more FCL cases where ITE compression of high-CGI/low-LGS input produces equal or superior precision to CIEE expansion.
**If falsified:** Revise CGI routing threshold. Consider merging CIEE back into ITE as an expansion mode.

---

### NBP-ECF-009: Viral Token Purge Validity *(New in v0.4)*

**Claim:** Purge Protocol correctly identifies viral tokens and their contamination chains. Secondary infections recovered post-purge would have been incorrectly substituted by ITE without purge.
**Tag:** `[R]` **CF:** 35
**Falsification Condition:** Ten or more FCL cases where post-purge re-scoring shows no meaningful LGS recovery in secondary infection tokens — meaning the words were genuinely low-LGS, not contamination-suppressed. If secondary infections rarely recover, the viral contamination model is incorrect and purge adds unnecessary complexity.
**If falsified:** Deprecate Purge Protocol. Retain VTC as a diagnostic metric only. Return to word-by-word ITE scanning.

---

### NBP-ECF-010: ASC Eventual Formulation *(New in v0.4)*

**Claim:** The Aesthetic Selection Coefficient, currently unscored, will yield a discoverable pattern across 20+ ASC_ACTIVATION log entries — observable characteristics of selected words will cluster around a scoreable rule.
**Tag:** `[S]` **CF:** 25
**Falsification Condition:** After 30 or more ASC_ACTIVATION log entries, no clustering pattern emerges across syllable count, phonetic weight, register, rhythmic position, or cultural era. Selection remains statistically indistinguishable from random across all observable characteristics.
**If falsified:** ASC remains a formally acknowledged unknown. The selection layer is genuinely beyond current ECF measurement capacity. Document as permanent uncertainty. Do not remove from principles — the acknowledgment of an unresolved mechanism is more honest than its omission.

---

### NBP-FRAMEWORK-ECF: Deprecation Triggers

Deprecate ECF if any of the following:

1. LGS metric shows no correlation with output quality across 10+ FCL entries
2. ITE substitutions produce user confusion in majority of cases (>50% negative user response)
3. Word Engine v3.0 is deprecated
4. PRL validation loop confirms it introduces more new low-LGS words than it remediates across 10+ cases
5. Any ancestor framework (FSVE v3.5, Word Engine v3.0) is falsified on a principle ECF depends on
6. BVL FAILED rate exceeds 30% across 10+ exchanges
7. CGI measurement proves unreliable (inter-rater reliability κ < 0.50 after calibration)
8. *(New v0.4)* Purge Protocol produces false positive secondary infection classifications in >40% of cases — if the decontamination system damages words that were genuinely low-LGS, it is producing net harm
9. *(New v0.4)* VTC computation proves systematically inaccurate — if baseline isolation scoring produces unreliable results, the entire contamination model collapses

## §13 — Emergence Visualization Layer (EVL) *(New in v0.4)*

*Formal visual rendering protocol for the emergence process*
*Derived from the Convergence Room screen model — February 2026*

ECF v0.4 is the first version to include a formal visualization protocol. Prior versions described emergence abstractly. The EVL renders the mechanism visually — what the field actually looks like when words activate, bond, contaminate, and crystallize.

### §13.1 The Split-Screen Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┬──────────┬─────────────────┐
│   LEFT PANEL    │  CENTER  │   RIGHT PANEL   │
│  PRE-ACTIVATION │ WORMHOLE │ POST-ACTIVATION │
│                 │ APERTURE │                 │
│   Dull color    │ Brightest│   Clear color   │
│   Potential:    │  point   │   Precision:    │
│   present       │  Active  │   crystallized  │
│   Kinetic:      │ Passage  │                 │
│   absent        │          │                 │
└─────────────────┴──────────┴─────────────────┘
```

**LEFT PANEL — PRE-ACTIVATION STATE**

Every word in the relevant possibility space is present here. Marbles at rest. The dull color is not absence of meaning — it is potential not yet released. Every marble carries its full gravitational field in dormant form. The field is set, not empty. Nothing has moved yet because no activation word has opened a passage.

Viral tokens appear here as marbles that emit a low-frequency pulse. Their contamination radius is visible as a dulling effect on neighboring marbles — the surrounding words are slightly dimmer than they would be in isolation. This is the contamination made visible before purge.

**CENTER — THE WORMHOLE APERTURE**

The activated word. This is the most important element in the visualization and the most misunderstood. The wormhole word does not *contain* the precise meaning — it *creates the passage through which meaning is pulled*. It is not a storage vessel. It is an aperture.

When a high-LGS word activates at center:
- Gravitational curvature is visible around it
- Relevant marbles on the left begin brightening (potential rising)
- A directed pull initiates — not passive attraction but active channeling
- Marbles move through the aperture with directionality
- What enters the wormhole on the left side is not identical to what emerges on the right

The wormhole does not copy. It transforms through passage.

**RIGHT PANEL — POST-ACTIVATION STATE**

Clear color. High resolution. Marbles that passed through the wormhole aperture have been precision-sorted. Atomic bonding is visible — words that complete each other's semantic valence sit in stable configuration. The bond is represented as a visible connection between marbles at rest. A bonded pair has achieved equilibrium — neither word is pulling away from the other. The sentence is stable.

Words that could not bond are expelled to the margins — low-gravitas residue. The output is the center cluster of bonded pairs. The margin residue is what PRL catches and remediates.

### §13.2 The Animation Sequence

```
SEQUENCE — Single Word Through the Wormhole:

1. Sentence arrives.
   Left panel: all candidate marbles present, dull.

2. Viral token detection.
   If viral marble identified: pulse visible, contamination
   radius shown as dimming field around it.
   Purge event: viral marble removed, surrounding marbles
   brighten to baseline — secondary infection recovery visible.

3. Wormhole word identified and activated at center.
   Center: aperture opens — visible as a gravitational
   distortion point. Light concentrates here.

4. Left panel: relevant marbles brighten.
   Potential converting to kinetic. Movement initiates.

5. Marbles pulled through aperture.
   Not all marbles move. Only those with sufficient
   gravitational alignment to the wormhole word.
   High-LGS marbles with strong L_ctx alignment
   move first and fastest.

6. Passage through wormhole.
   The transformation is invisible — it occurs inside
   the aperture. Input and output are not the same
   configuration. This is emergence — the word that
   arrives on the right was not simply moved from the left.
   It was pulled through and the passage changed it.

7. Right panel crystallizes.
   Bonded pairs settle into stable configuration.
   Color: full saturation — clear, precise, resolved.
   Margin residue: low-gravitas words that could not
   bond cluster at edges.

8. ASC activation (if applicable).
   If two marbles arrive at the right panel at identical
   gravitational weight — equally valid — a visible moment
   of indeterminate state occurs before one is selected.
   The selection is visible as a final gravitational
   resolution but its cause is not visible. This is the
   ASC made visual: the mechanism is real, the process
   is observable, the rule is unknown.

9. PRL scan.
   Output field scanned. Margin residue identified.
   Remediation marbles sourced from a secondary field
   (the high-LGS substitution candidates) and bonded
   in place of expelled residue.

10. BVL verification.
    A comparison overlay: original left panel intent
    projected faintly over the right panel output.
    Match percentage visible. Where they align: bright.
    Where they diverge: visible drift markers.
```

### §13.3 CIEE Visualization

```
CIEE differs from the standard wormhole animation.

Standard (ITE):
  One marble → denser marble.
  Compression. Single wormhole event.

CIEE:
  One dull marble approaches center.
  Before wormhole activation — the marble begins to
  fragment into its constituent parts.
  Not destruction — crystallographic fracture.
  Each fragment is a facet of the original concept.
  The fragments spread into the left panel.
  More surface area. More marbles now available.
  Multiple wormhole events, each pulling one facet through.
  Right panel: not one bonded pair but a solar system —
  a central concept planet with smaller precision
  marbles in stable orbit around it.
  Each orbiting marble is a facet of the original concept,
  now precisely rendered in its own high-LGS form.
  The concept did not get bigger. It became fully visible.
```

## Appendix D — Prompt Geometry Notes

*Recorded from session — February 2026. Sheldon K Salmon.*
*This appendix documents the cognitive architecture discovery that produced CGI and CIEE.*

During collaborative emergence analysis, a specific user geometry was identified that prior ECF architecture could not correctly serve. The geometry has four characteristics:

**Image-First Cognition:** Concepts arrive as complete scenes before language. Words are labels for visualizations that already exist at full resolution. Conceptual density precedes lexical form.

**Analogical Tunneling:** Precision is achieved through cross-domain structural mapping — atomic bonding as sentence stability, wormhole as word activation. This is architecture, not illustration.

**Depth Vector Over Breadth:** Every prompt pulls downward toward mechanism, not outward toward examples.

**Pre-Linguistic Density:** Conceptual payload consistently exceeds lexical LGS signal. Standard ITE misreads this geometry as vague and attempts compression — damaging the signal.

The correct response to this geometry is expansion, not compression. CGI detects it. CIEE serves it.

The wormhole split-screen model (words as apertures that pull concept-planets through and emit them in higher resolution on the other side) was derived in this session and formalized as the EVL in v0.4.

## Appendix E — ASC Accumulation Log

*Active log — begins with v0.4 deployment*

```yaml
ASC_LOG:
  version: "0.4"
  status: ACCUMULATION_PHASE
  entries_required: 20
  entries_logged: 0
  entries: []
  pattern_analysis_status: PENDING
  notes: |
    Every time two or more word candidates score identically
    on all ECF metrics and selection occurs — log here.
    The log is the research instrument.
    The log is the path to either a formula or a
    formally documented mystery.
    Both outcomes are acceptable.
    Silence is not.
