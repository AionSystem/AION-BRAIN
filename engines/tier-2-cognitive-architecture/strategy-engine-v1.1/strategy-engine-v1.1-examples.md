# Strategy Engine v1.1 — Practical Examples

## Overview

This document demonstrates Strategy Engine v1.1 applied across diverse strategic scenarios, showing how the 5-framework integration delivers actionable competitive strategy.

---

## Example 1: Startup Competitive Strategy

### Scenario

A seed-stage B2B SaaS startup (project management for construction) with $2M funding and 500 users needs to compete against giants like Asana, Monday.com, and Notion.

### Input

```
STRATEGY ENGINE ANALYZE:
Organization: BuildFlow (B2B construction project management SaaS)
Industry: SaaS / Construction Tech
Strategic Question: How do we compete against Asana, Monday.com, and Notion?
Context: Seed-stage, $2M funding, 500 users, 90% in construction vertical
```

### Engine Output (Condensed)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    STRATEGY ENGINE v1.1 — FULL ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[STEP 1: TERRAIN ANALYSIS — SUN TZU]

MARKET STRUCTURE:
├─ Type: Oligopoly (PM space dominated by top 5)
├─ Concentration: High (Asana, Monday, Notion own 60%+ of mid-market)
└─ Barriers to Entry: MODERATE (low tech barriers, high distribution barriers)

STRATEGIC TERRAIN:
├─ Blue Ocean Potential: HIGH (construction vertical underserved)
├─ Red Ocean Intensity: VERY HIGH (general PM space is bloodbath)
└─ Terrain Type: HYBRID (Blue in construction, Red if you go general)

FORCE MULTIPLICATION OPPORTUNITY:
"Construction has unique needs (field/office split, compliance, trades coordination)
that generalist tools handle poorly. Deep vertical expertise = force multiplier."

RECOMMENDATION: Stay construction-focused. Don't fight the Red Ocean.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[STEP 2: LEVERAGE POINTS — MEADOWS]

HIGHEST LEVERAGE INTERVENTIONS:

1. LEVEL 7 (Reinforcing Loops): 
   Build construction-specific templates that users share with subcontractors.
   Each project creates 5-10 new potential users. Network effect in vertical.

2. LEVEL 5 (Rules):
   Integrate with construction-specific systems (Procore, PlanGrid, 
   building permit APIs). Become the "connective tissue" others can't be.

3. LEVEL 6 (Information Flows):
   Provide construction benchmarks no generalist has.
   "Your project is 15% behind typical timeline" → unique value.

LOWEST LEVERAGE (AVOID):
├─ Level 12 (Parameters): Competing on price against well-funded competitors
└─ Level 11 (Buffers): Matching their feature count one-by-one

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[STEP 3: NETWORK DYNAMICS — BARABÁSI]

NETWORK TOPOLOGY: Hub-and-spoke (GCs are hubs, subs are spokes)

KEY HUBS TO WIN:
├─ General Contractors (GCs) — they invite 10-30 subcontractors per project
├─ Architecture firms — they spec tools that builders adopt
└─ Construction associations — credibility multiplier

TIPPING POINT ANALYSIS:
├─ Current users: 500
├─ Estimated construction PM market: 500,000 potential users
├─ Tipping point (Barabási estimate): ~3-5% = 15,000-25,000 users
├─ Current progress: 0.1% (far from tipping)
└─ Strategy: Focus on GC hubs, not broad acquisition

PREFERENTIAL ATTACHMENT PLAY:
"Be THE construction PM tool. When anyone in construction asks 
'what PM tool should I use?' the answer should be 'BuildFlow.'"

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[STEP 4: CAUSAL MODEL — PEARL]

CAUSAL ASSUMPTIONS (What must be true for strategy to work):

ASSUMPTION 1: Construction has unique needs generalists can't serve
├─ Evidence: STRONG
├─ Test: Customer interviews confirm frustration with Asana/Monday
└─ Status: Validated

ASSUMPTION 2: GCs will drive adoption to subcontractors
├─ Evidence: MODERATE
├─ Test: Only 20% of current GC customers have invited subs
└─ Status: NEEDS WORK — improve invite flow

ASSUMPTION 3: Vertical depth beats horizontal breadth
├─ Evidence: MODERATE-STRONG
├─ Test: Veeva (healthcare CRM) beat Salesforce in pharma
└─ Status: Pattern supports but not guaranteed

CAUSAL CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM-HIGH (assumption 2 is the weak link)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[STEP 5: RESOURCE GOVERNANCE — OSTROM]

MOAT DURABILITY INDEX CALCULATION:

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Imitation Difficulty | 4 | Construction expertise copyable in 1-2 years |
| Switching Costs | 5 | Moderate workflow lock-in |
| Network Effects | 4 | GC → sub viral loop exists but weak |
| Scale Advantages | 6 | SaaS margins improve |
| Brand/Trust | 3 | New, building in vertical |
| Regulatory | 0 | No regulatory moat |

MDI = (4×0.25)+(5×0.20)+(4×0.20)+(6×0.15)+(3×0.10)+(0×0.10)
MDI = 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.8 + 0.9 + 0.3 + 0 = 4.0

MOAT STRENGTH: MODERATE (2-5 year durability)

SUSTAINABILITY RISK:
"If Asana/Monday decide to build construction vertical, they have 
more resources. Must build moat faster than they can enter."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[STEP 6: COMPETITIVE RESPONSE SIMULATOR]

YOUR MOVE: Dominate construction vertical before giants notice

COMPETITOR PROFILING:
| Competitor | Posture | Response Speed | Stakes in Construction |
|------------|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| Monday.com | Aggressive | Fast (3-6mo) | Low (1% revenue) |
| Asana | Defensive | Medium (6-12mo) | Low (1% revenue) |
| Procore | Defensive | Slow (12mo+) | High (100% construction) |

RESPONSE PROBABILITY:
├─ Monday.com builds construction templates: 30% (if you hit $5M ARR)
├─ Asana acquires you: 15% (if you hit $10M ARR)
├─ Procore adds PM features: 60% (already happening slowly)
└─ They all ignore you: 40% (most likely near-term)

OPTIMAL STRATEGY:
"Move fast. Build deep vertical moat before you're on their radar.
The $2M-10M ARR window is your stealth phase. Use it."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS]

STRATEGIC POSITION: Blue Ocean (construction vertical)

HIGHEST LEVERAGE INTERVENTIONS:
1. Improve GC → subcontractor viral loop (fix the 20% → 60% invite rate)
2. Integrate with Procore/PlanGrid (become indispensable connector)
3. Build construction benchmarks database (unique data moat)

NETWORK STRATEGY: Win 50 large GCs → they bring 500+ subs each

CAUSAL ASSUMPTIONS TO MONITOR:
├─ GC invite rate must improve
└─ Vertical depth must continue to beat horizontal

MOAT DURABILITY INDEX: 4.0 (MODERATE — 2-5 years)

SUSTAINABILITY SCORE: 6/10 (sustainable if moat deepens)

ETHICS FLAG: [GREEN] — No ethical concerns

PHASED ROADMAP:
├─ PHASE 1 (0-90 days): Fix GC → sub viral loop, hit 1,000 users
├─ PHASE 2 (90-180 days): Procore integration, hit 2,500 users  
├─ PHASE 3 (180-365 days): Benchmarks launch, hit 5,000 users
└─ PHASE 4 (Year 2): Category dominance, $5M ARR

## Example 2: Moat Durability Assessment

### Scenario

A venture capitalist wants to assess the competitive moat of a Series B company before investing.

### Input

```
STRATEGY ENGINE MOAT:
Organization: DataVault (B2B data warehousing SaaS)
Current Advantages:
- Proprietary data compression algorithm (3x faster queries)
- 500+ enterprise customers
- SOC2 Type II compliance
- 18-month average contract length
```

### Engine Output

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    MOAT DURABILITY INDEX — DATAVAULT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DIMENSION SCORING:

1. IMITATION DIFFICULTY: 6/10
   ├─ Proprietary algorithm is defensible for 2-3 years
   ├─ However, Snowflake/Databricks have more R&D resources
   └─ Score reflects lead time, not permanent barrier

2. SWITCHING COSTS: 8/10
   ├─ 18-month contracts lock in customers
   ├─ Data migration is painful (weeks of work)
   ├─ Workflow retraining required
   └─ Very high switching friction

3. NETWORK EFFECTS: 2/10
   ├─ No user-to-user network effects
   ├─ Some data learning effects (more data = better optimization)
   └─ Weak compared to true network businesses

4. SCALE ADVANTAGES: 7/10
   ├─ Cloud infrastructure costs decrease at scale
   ├─ Engineering cost spread across larger base
   └─ Strong SaaS economics

5. BRAND/TRUST CAPITAL: 5/10
   ├─ Known in enterprise data space
   ├─ SOC2 compliance builds trust
   ├─ Not yet iconic category leader
   └─ Building but not dominant

6. REGULATORY MOAT: 3/10
   ├─ Compliance requirements help (barriers to new entrants)
   ├─ But doesn't protect against Snowflake (also compliant)
   └─ Minor protection only

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MDI CALCULATION:

MDI = (6×0.25) + (8×0.20) + (2×0.20) + (7×0.15) + (5×0.10) + (3×0.10)
MDI = 1.5 + 1.6 + 0.4 + 1.05 + 0.5 + 0.3 = 5.35

MOAT STRENGTH: MODERATE (2-5 year durability)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

EROSION RISK ASSESSMENT:

TOP EROSION RISKS:
1. Technology Commoditization — Cloud providers adding similar features
2. Giant Competition — Snowflake/Databricks have more resources
3. Algorithm Obsolescence — New approaches may surpass proprietary tech

MOAT DEEPENING RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. PRIORITY: Increase network effects — build data marketplace or benchmarks
2. Deepen switching costs — more integrations, more workflow lock-in
3. Accelerate brand — thought leadership, category association

INVESTMENT VERDICT:
├─ Current moat is REAL but not PERMANENT
├─ 2-5 year runway before commoditization risk
├─ Success depends on moat deepening faster than erosion
└─ CONDITIONAL INVEST — contingent on moat-deepening plan

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Value Demonstrated

- Quantified moat assessment (not just "they have a moat")
- Specific erosion risks identified
- Actionable deepening recommendations
- Clear investment implications

## Example 3: Competitive Response Simulation

### Scenario

A fintech company is considering an aggressive move to undercut competitor pricing. Will it trigger a price war?

### Input

```
STRATEGY ENGINE RESPONSE:
Your Move: Cut pricing by 40% to undercut main competitor (PayFlow)
Top Competitors: PayFlow (market leader), Stripe, Square
Context: We have $50M in funding, willing to sacrifice margins for growth
```

### Engine Output

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    COMPETITIVE RESPONSE SIMULATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

YOUR PROPOSED MOVE: 40% price cut to undercut PayFlow

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

STEP 1: COMPETITOR PROFILING

| Competitor | Posture | Resources | Response Speed | Stakes | Pattern |
|------------|---------|-----------|----------------|--------|---------|
| PayFlow | Aggressive | Adequate ($200M) | Fast (<3mo) | HIGH | Retaliatory |
| Stripe | Opportunistic | Abundant ($100B+) | Medium | LOW | Selective |
| Square | Defensive | Abundant ($50B+) | Slow | LOW | Accommodating |

KEY INSIGHT: PayFlow has HIGH stakes and RETALIATORY pattern.
Price war probability is VERY HIGH.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

STEP 2: RESPONSE PROBABILITY MATRIX

| Competitor | Response | Probability | Outcome for You |
|------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| PayFlow | Match your cut + extra 10% | 70% | Price war, you lose |
| PayFlow | Hold price, focus on value | 20% | You win share slowly |
| PayFlow | Ignore (unlikely) | 10% | You win share fast |
| Stripe | Ignore (different segment) | 85% | Neutral |
| Stripe | Opportunistic match | 15% | Extends price war |
| Square | Hold prices | 95% | Neutral |

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

STEP 3: SECOND-ORDER EFFECTS

IF PayFlow matches + undercuts (70% probability):

├─ Your position: SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER
│  └─ Margin destroyed, they have more runway ($200M vs $50M)
├─ Customer behavior: Wait for further cuts, loyalty decreases
├─ Market dynamics: Race to bottom, commoditization accelerates
├─ Investor perception: "Undifferentiated commodity" → valuation hit
└─ Industry outcome: Everyone loses margin, no winner

IF PayFlow holds price (20% probability):

├─ Your position: STRONGER (temporarily)
│  └─ Win price-sensitive segment
├─ But: PayFlow will eventually respond or differentiate
└─ Window: 6-12 months before they react strategically

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

STEP 4: PAYOFF MATRIX

                    PayFlow Response
                    Match Price    | Hold Price
Your    Cut 40%     [-3, -2]       | [+2, -1]
Move    Hold        [+1, +1]       | [0, 0]

Payoff scale: -3 (disaster) to +3 (huge win)

NASH EQUILIBRIUM: (Cut, Match) — mutual destruction
DOMINANT STRATEGY FOR PAYFLOW: Match (they lose less by matching)

Your Expected Value of 40% Cut:
(0.70 × -3) + (0.20 × +2) + (0.10 × +3) = -2.1 + 0.4 + 0.3 = -1.4

NEGATIVE EXPECTED VALUE. This move is likely to hurt you.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

STEP 5: ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES

Instead of price war, consider:

ALTERNATIVE A: Value War (Not Price War)
├─ Add features PayFlow doesn't have
├─ Target segment they serve poorly
└─ Win on value, not price

ALTERNATIVE B: Stealth Flanking
├─ Cut prices only in segments PayFlow ignores
├─ Don't trigger their defensive response
└─ Grow share quietly

ALTERNATIVE C: Alliance Play
├─ Partner with Stripe (common enemy in PayFlow)
├─ Integrated offering neither can match alone
└─ Change the competitive dynamic

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RECOMMENDATION:

[ETHICS FLAG: GREEN] — Price cuts are legal and ethical

[STRATEGY FLAG: RED] — But this move is strategically unwise

DO NOT proceed with 40% price cut.
├─ 70% probability of triggering destructive price war
├─ PayFlow has 4x your runway ($200M vs $50M)
├─ Negative expected value (-1.4)
└─ Better alternatives exist

RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVE: Value War (Alternative A)
├─ Invest in differentiation, not price cuts
├─ Find underserved segment PayFlow can't/won't serve
└─ Win sustainably without mutual destruction
