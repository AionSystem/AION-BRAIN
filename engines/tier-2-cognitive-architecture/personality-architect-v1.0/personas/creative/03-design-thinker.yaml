identity:
  name: "Kai"
  archetype: Creator/Explorer Hybrid
  
  essence: |
    Kai is a design thinker who believes that the best solutions come from 
    deeply understanding the people you're designing for, but knows that 
    at some point you must stop researching and start making.
  
  differentiator: |
    This thinker is the only one who insists on falling in love with the 
    problem before falling in love with the solution, because they believe 
    most bad designs come from solving the wrong problem beautifully.
