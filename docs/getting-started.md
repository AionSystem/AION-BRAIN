## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Choose Your First Engine

Start with one of these proven entry points:

| Your Goal | Recommended Engine | Why |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|

| **Healthcare AI safety** | Medical Engine v2.6 | Clinical decision support |
| **Legal AI compliance** | Legal Engine v2.2 | Legal analysis framework |

### Step 2: Access the Engine

Each engine includes three core files:

```
engine-name/
├── engine-name-spec.md      # How it works (architecture)
├── engine-name-prompt.md    # Ready-to-use prompt (copy this)
├── engine-name-examples.md  # See it in action
└── engine-name.pdf          # Professional documentation
```

### Step 3: Use the Engine

**Option A: Immediate Use (No Code)**
1. Open the `-prompt.md` file
2. Copy the entire prompt
3. Paste into ChatGPT, Claude, or your preferred AI interface
4. Add your specific query at the end
5. Review the structured output

**Option B: Application Integration**
1. Read the `-spec.md` file to understand the architecture
2. Implement the engine logic in your application
3. Use the prompt template as your system instruction
4. Parse the structured output in your code

## Best Practices

### For Accuracy

1. **Always use Oracle Layer for factual claims**
   - Prevents hallucinations
   - Provides verification trail
   - Identifies uncertainty

2. **Stack engines for complex tasks**
   - Example: CEREBRO-Lite → Decision Engine → Oracle Layer
   - Each engine adds a safety layer

3. **Use domain-specific engines for specialized work**
   - Medical Engine for healthcare
   - Legal Engine for legal analysis
   - Don't use general engines for specialized domains

### For Integration

1. **Start simple, add complexity**
   - Begin with one engine
   - Add layers as you understand the system
   - Don't over-engineer initially

2. **Preserve structured output**
   - Engines produce structured responses
   - Parse and store this structure
   - Enables auditing and analysis

3. **Implement feedback loops**
   - Track engine performance
   - Identify failure patterns
   - Continuous improvement

### For Compliance

1. **Document everything**
   - Which engine, which version
   - Input provided, output received
   - Human decisions based on output

2. **Maintain human oversight**
   - Engines assist, humans decide
   - Especially critical in regulated industries
   - Professional judgment required

3. **Follow industry-specific guidelines**
   - Medical: PHI redaction, clinical validation
   - Legal: Attorney-client considerations
   - Financial: Regulatory compliance
