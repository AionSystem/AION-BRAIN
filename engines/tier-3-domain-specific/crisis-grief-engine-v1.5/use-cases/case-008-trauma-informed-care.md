TRAUMA-INFORMED GRIEF CARE PRINCIPLES
=====================================

[PROFESSIONAL EDUCATIONAL FRAMEWORK]

SECTION 1: TRAUMA AND GRIEF INTERSECTION
────────────────────────────────────────

When Grief is Traumatic:

TRAUMATIC LOSS TYPES:
├─ SUDDEN DEATH
│   ├─ No time to prepare
│   ├─ No goodbye opportunity
│   ├─ Shock response common
│   └─ "What if" rumination
│
├─ VIOLENT DEATH
│   ├─ Homicide, suicide, accident
│   ├─ Intrusive imagery
│   ├─ Criminal justice involvement
│   └─ Media exposure risk
│
├─ WITNESSED DEATH
│   ├─ First responders, family present
│   ├─ PTSD symptoms common
│   ├─ Sensory triggers
│   └─ Helplessness/guilt
│
├─ MULTIPLE LOSS
│   ├─ Mass casualty events
│   ├─ COVID-19 compounded loss
│   ├─ Serial loss over time
│   └─ Grief accumulation
│
└─ CIRCUMSTANCES
    ├─ Unable to view body
    ├─ Body condition traumatic
    ├─ Extended uncertainty (missing person)
    └─ Stigmatized death

TRAUMA VS. GRIEF (Not Either/Or):

Standard Grief:
├─ Longing and yearning
├─ Sadness, crying
├─ Waves of grief
├─ Gradually decreasing intensity
└─ Memories often comforting eventually

Trauma Response:
├─ Intrusive re-experiencing
├─ Avoidance behaviors
├─ Hyperarousal
├─ Negative cognitions
└─ Memories trigger distress

BOTH can coexist and interact.
Treatment may need to address both.

TRIGGER MANAGEMENT:
├─ Ask about known triggers

└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:clinical_assessment]

AVOIDING:
├─ Forced confrontation with trauma details
├─ Invalidating or minimizing
├─ Pushing forgiveness or "moving on"
├─ Unsolicited advice
