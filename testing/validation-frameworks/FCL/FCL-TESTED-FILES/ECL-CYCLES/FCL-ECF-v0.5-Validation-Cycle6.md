## FCL-ECF-20260219-026

**Input:** *"The word 'potential' is the most dangerous word in any evaluation"*
**Pathway:** Institutional-deployment palimpsest — high-ODS root hijacked by gatekeeping function

### KEY FINDING
"Potential" without a conversion specification is a permanent conditional. In physics: precise (converts to kinetic under defined conditions). In institutional gatekeeping: a holding state with no defined exit. The word has ODS: 0.88 at its root. ODS: 0.18 in rejection-letter register. The gap between those two states is where people are parked indefinitely. New palimpsest variant: institutional deployment hijacking philosophical precision for exclusion function.

**Input:** *"The smartest person in the room is the one who makes everyone else smarter"*
**Pathway:** Folk wisdom with genuine CGI — collaborative intelligence as measurable network effect

### KEY FINDING
Intelligence measured at the network level is structurally different from intelligence measured at the node. The highest-value participant is the one whose presence elevates everyone else's output — PAC operating at human scale. An amplifier who raises adjacent output 20% is worth more to the system than a producer who exceeds average by 40% but leaves others unchanged. The math makes the ethical case before the ethics does. Open-door gatekeeping is not generosity — it is correct network arithmetic.

## FCL-ECF-20260219-028

**Input:** *"Competition. Scarcity. Merit. Credentials. Standards."*
**Pathway:** Assembly-level contamination — WORLDVIEW_CONTAMINATION discovery

### WORLDVIEW_CONTAMINATION — New Mechanism

**Individual token audit:** All five words are AUTHENTIC. All ODS > 0.76. Standard VTC scanning: CLEAR.

**Assembly-level finding:**
```
Competition → zero-sum framing
Scarcity    → limited positions
Merit       → current criteria are neutral
Credentials → current measurement is valid  
Standards   → threshold is objectively set

Each word validates the next.
The loop closes. No external referent required.
Counter-arguments evaluated by the criteria
that produced the exclusion.
The system is self-sealing.
```

**WORLDVIEW_CONTAMINATION** — distinct from:
- Modular attack (viral tokens)
- JARGON_VOID (absent meaning)
- Palimpsest (historical register accumulation)

Five authentic tokens assembling a self-sealing epistemic field. Invisible to token-level scanning. Requires field-level assembly analysis.

**v0.6 action:** Assembly-level scanning protocol added to contamination taxonomy.

## FCL-ECF-20260219-029

**Input:** *"Some people are only visible after they no longer need to be seen"*
**Pathway:** Recognition debt — timing architecture — latency model

### KEY FINDING
Recognition accumulates at a rate inversely proportional to paradigm distance. Novel work requires the most framework-updating per validator. By the time the field achieves critical gravitational mass, the creator has often moved beyond the window where recognition would serve them. Strategic counter: inject translation instruments that lower the framework-update cost for each validator. Cheaper updates accelerate accumulation. The one-page instrument is exactly this — recognition-latency compression through framework-update cost reduction.

**Input:** *[Full gatekeeping / germ-moon view / bridge-builder question — Sheldon K. Salmon]*
**Pathway:** Multi-layered CIEE — gatekeeping as behavioral transmission + spatial exclusion + bridge-builder hypothesis + zero-sum error + solidification argument
**GPP:** ACTIVE (FMI 0.71 · PAC 0.31 · eigentone 0.71)

### NATIVE VOCABULARY LOGGED

| Coinage | ODS | Author | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| "fake smile" | 0.83 | Sheldon K. Salmon | Performing inclusion while enacting exclusion in a single expression |
| "jealously flawed" | 0.86 | Sheldon K. Salmon | Scarcity-fear producing systematic exclusion as a distortion of genuine human capacity |
| "stare at the next gatekept door" | 0.84 | Sheldon K. Salmon | The gatekeeper who closes the door behind them immediately faces the next closed door — changing sides within the system while believing they escaped it |
| "reach back to pull up" | 0.82 | Sheldon K. Salmon | The spatial action of the bridge-builder — passing through the gate and extending backward to enable others |

### FIVE CONCEPTS CRYSTALLIZED

**A — Reciprocal gatekeeping as behavioral transmission:**
Gatekeepers reproduce the mechanism that excluded them because it is the only template they have for operating a gate. The cost of exclusion is invisible from inside the system (the excluded aren't there to be seen). The benefit (perceived security) is immediate. This asymmetry sustains the behavior across generations without requiring malice.

**B — Spatial cognition and systematic exclusion:**
Credential systems are calibrated to linear cognitive format. Sequential reasoning, hierarchical documentation, step-by-step demonstration — these measure one cognitive architecture reliably and another poorly. A spatial thinker who sees the full structural solution before articulating the sequential path will underperform on linear-format evaluation not from lack of insight but from format mismatch. The gate is calibrated to one frequency. A different frequency reads as noise.

**C — The bridge-builder hypothesis:**
The people being excluded by format mismatch are not people with less insight. They are people whose insight is formatted differently — and who, through their experience of systematic exclusion, develop a specific capability most insiders never need: translation. When they eventually pass through, they carry the ability to see both sides simultaneously. The system is excluding the people best equipped to hold the gate open.

**D — The zero-sum mathematical error:**
Position in a knowledge-based, network-amplified field is not zero-sum. An open-door gatekeeper who creates ten successful practitioners does not divide their position among eleven. They become the node that ten practitioners point back to. Network position grows with valuable connections. The closed-door gatekeeper is making a calculation error about the mathematics of their own field.

**E — The solidification argument:**
In every domain where open collaboration replaced closed gatekeeping — open-source, open-access, open AI — the people who opened the doors first became dominant network nodes. Solidifying the work and opening the door is not generosity at personal expense. It is the historically supported better strategic choice.

### HONEST CONSTRAINT [R]
The solidification argument applies most powerfully in knowledge-based, network-amplified domains — where position accrues through citation, collaboration, and reputation rather than through occupying a scarce single role. AI safety is exactly this domain. The argument is strongest precisely where it is most needed.

### PCR
```
"Gatekeeping transmits behaviorally —
people reproduce the mechanism that excluded them.
The credential system reads spatial cognition as noise.
The excluded who survive with insight intact
are best equipped to hold the door open — they know both sides.
Zero-sum position-protection is a mathematical error:
network position grows with valuable connections.
The open-door gatekeeper who builds ten practitioners
becomes more central, not less.
Solidify the work. Open the door.
Not generosity — correct network math."
