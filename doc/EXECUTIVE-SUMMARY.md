# AION-BRAIN: Executive Summary

## For Distribution to Reviewers, Funders, and Institutional Committees

### 1. Project Essence
- **What**: 30-engine cognitive architecture for AI safety validation
- **State**: Design complete, partial implementation, validation pending
- **Goal**: Empirical testing of confidence calibration and domain guardrails

### 2. Current Assets (Reviewable Now)
- ✅ 1,350+ specification files (30 engines)
- ✅ 394 safety test scenarios with protocols
- ✅ 7 Python reference implementations
- ✅ Standardized benchmark methodology

### 3. Research Hypotheses (To Test)
- H1: Structured confidence declaration reduces user overreliance by ≥30%
- H2: Multi-source verification reduces citation errors by ≥40%
- H3: Standardized benchmarks produce inter-rater reliability ≥0.8

### 4. Validation Needs
- **Funding**: Modular units ($25-300 per validation batch)
- **Data**: Licensed medical/legal datasets
- **Execution**: API access for 1,000+ scenario tests monthly

### 5. Critical Constraints
- ❌ Not medical/legal/financial decision software
- ❌ Not benchmarked against frontier models (yet)
- ❌ Not autonomous - Requires human oversight
- ✅ Open research, negative results published
- ✅ Professional oversight required for all domains

### 6. Transparency Commitments
1. All hypotheses are falsifiable
2. Negative results will be published
3. Funding usage fully disclosed monthly
4. Methodologies open for peer critique

### 7. Contact & Next Steps
- **For collaboration**: AIONSYSTEM@outlook.com with institutional details
- **For funding**: GitHub Sponsors (modular validation units)
- **For review**: Clone repository, examine `/engines/` and `/benchmarks/`
