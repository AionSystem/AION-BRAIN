# AION-BRAIN — Disclaimers & Expectations

**Last Updated:** November 2024

This document outlines important disclaimers, limitations, and expectations for users of the AION-BRAIN repository. Please read before using, forking, or contributing.

## 1. AI-Assisted Development

This project was designed and architected by **Sheldon K. Salmon (Mr. AION)**, a cognitive architect and AI safety researcher who is not a professional software developer. 

**All code, scripts, and technical implementations were developed with AI assistance.**

### What This Means:
- The **intellectual frameworks, methodologies, and architectural designs** are original human work
- The **code implementations** are AI-generated reference examples
- Code is **functional** but provided as **demonstration**, not production-hardened software
- Developers should **review, test, and adapt** code before production deployment
- **Contributions that improve code quality are welcome**

### Why This Matters:
AI-assisted development is increasingly common and accepted. This disclosure is provided for transparency, not as an apology. The value of this project lies in its **ideas, frameworks, and methodologies** — the code demonstrates how to apply them.

## 2. Not Professional Advice

Several engines in this repository address sensitive domains:

| Engine | Domain | Limitation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Legal Engine | Law | NOT legal advice. Educational only. |
| Medical Engine | Healthcare | NOT medical advice. Educational only. |
| Financial Literacy | Finance | NOT financial advice. Educational only. |
| Health Literacy | Wellness | NOT health advice. Educational only. |

### Critical Warnings:

**LEGAL ENGINE:**
> This engine provides legal education and literacy tools. It does NOT provide legal advice, does NOT create an attorney-client relationship, and should NOT be used as a substitute for licensed legal counsel. Laws vary by jurisdiction. Always consult a licensed attorney for legal matters.

**MEDICAL ENGINE:**
> This engine provides health education and safety frameworks. It does NOT provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations. It is NOT a substitute for professional medical care. Always consult qualified healthcare providers for medical decisions.

**FINANCIAL LITERACY:**
> This engine provides financial education concepts. It does NOT provide investment advice, tax advice, or personalized financial recommendations. Always consult licensed financial professionals for financial decisions.

### Personas with Specialist Knowledge:
Pre-built personas in sensitive domains (Legal Literacy, Health Literacy, Financial Literacy, Data Guide) include mandatory **DISCLAIM** and **ESCALATE** states. These are designed for education only and include crisis escalation protocols.

## 3. Reference Implementation

All code in this repository is provided as **reference implementation**.

### This Means:
- Code demonstrates concepts and methodologies
- Code is **not guaranteed** to be production-ready
- Code may require adaptation for your specific environment
- Dependencies, APIs, and libraries may change over time
- Error handling may not cover all edge cases

### Your Responsibility:
- Review code before using in production
- Test thoroughly in your environment
- Update dependencies as needed
- Implement additional error handling as required
- Adapt to your security requirements

## 5. Experimental Features

Engines marked as **Tier 4 - Experimental** are research prototypes:

- Truth Engine
- Quantum Computing Simulator
- Medical Engine v3 Preview
- Cultural Lens Engine
- Anti-Fragility Stress Test

### Experimental engines:
- May have incomplete implementations
- May change significantly between versions
- Are not recommended for production use
- Are provided for research and exploration

---

## 6. Compliance Features Are Guidance

This repository includes compliance-related features:

- GDPR memory handling
- CCPA support
- Jurisdictional overrides
- Audit trail frameworks

### Important:
These features are **guidance and frameworks**, NOT legal compliance guarantees.

- Compliance requirements vary by jurisdiction
- Regulations change over time
- Implementation details matter
- **Always consult legal counsel** for compliance requirements
- **You are responsible** for ensuring your use complies with applicable laws

---

## 7. Ethical Use Requirement

This project is released under Apache License 2.0 with an expectation of ethical use.

### Do NOT use this project to:
- Create deceptive AI personas that mislead users about their nature
- Manipulate or exploit vulnerable individuals
- Generate harmful, illegal, or unethical content
- Circumvent safety mechanisms in AI systems
- Violate privacy or consent principles
- Create systems designed to cause harm

### The frameworks include:
- Transparency requirements (AI nature disclosure)
- Crisis escalation protocols
- Dependency prevention mechanisms
- Consent-aware memory management
- Ethical alignment matrices

These exist because **ethical AI matters**. Please honor this intent.

---

## 8. Contributions & Community

### Contributions Welcome:
- Bug fixes and code improvements
- Documentation enhancements
- New persona templates
- Framework extensions
- Translation and localization

### Contribution Expectations:
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Include appropriate documentation
- Respect the project's ethical guidelines
- Be constructive and professional

### No Guaranteed Support:
This is an open-source project maintained by an individual. Response times may vary. Community support is encouraged.

---

## 9. Versioning & Stability

### Semantic Versioning:
- **Major versions** (v1.0, v2.0) may include breaking changes
- **Minor versions** (v2.1, v2.2) add features, maintain compatibility
- **Patch versions** (v2.1.1) are bug fixes only

### Stability Tiers:
- **Tier 1 (Foundation):** Most stable, core frameworks
- **Tier 2 (Cognitive Architecture):** Stable, well-tested
- **Tier 3 (Domain-Specific):** Stable for specific domains
- **Tier 4 (Experimental):** Unstable, research-only
