## What Is This

Five frameworks that tell you, in real time, whether your AI output can be trusted — and exactly how much.

**One framework is already proven. Four are being validated now.**

---

## Framework Status

| Framework | What It Does | FCL Entries | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| 🔵 **FSVE v3.5** | Certainty scoring — 6 axes, [0–1] | 0 / 5 | M-MODERATE |
| 🟣 **AION v3.0** | Fragility mapping — where your AI breaks | 0 / 5 | M-MODERATE |
| 🟠 **ASL v2.0** | Graduated safety — 5 tiers, not binary | 0 / 5 | M-MODERATE |
| 🟢 **GENESIS v1.0** | Pattern validation — compose AI safely | 0 / 5 | M-MODERATE |
| ✅ **ECF v0.5** | Lexical precision QA — language that executes correctly | **30 / 30** | **M-STRONG** |

## ECF Is Already Proven

![ECF](https://img.shields.io/badge/ECF_v0.5-M--STRONG-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)
![Entries](https://img.shields.io/badge/FCL_entries-30_real-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)
![Failures](https://img.shields.io/badge/BVL_failures-0-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)
![EV](https://img.shields.io/badge/epistemic_validity-0.716-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)
![Intent](https://img.shields.io/badge/intent_match-92.0%25-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)

30 real validation entries. 6 cycles. 0 failures. All timestamped before outcomes were known.

**What ECF found that standard review misses:**
- 🕳️ **JARGON_VOID** — sentences performing the appearance of meaning with nothing underneath
- 🌐 **WORLDVIEW_CONTAMINATION** — individually valid words assembling a self-sealing epistemic trap
- 🔒 **TRANSCENDENT_REFERENT** — the boundary where language structurally cannot go

## Certainty Stack

![Stack](https://img.shields.io/badge/certainty_stack-M--MODERATE-yellow?style=for-the-badge)
![Validations](https://img.shields.io/badge/validations-0%2F20_pending-orange?style=for-the-badge)
![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/FSVE_demo-live_on_Poe-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)

The four certainty stack frameworks are fully specified and mathematically consistent. Empirical pilot validation is next.

**Hypotheses under test (not yet proven):**
- FSVE → 30–50% faster deployment cycles
- AION → 2× deeper reasoning without collapse
- ASL → higher uptime under stress vs binary systems
- GENESIS → 5× faster pattern composition

## Transparency

![Negative Results](https://img.shields.io/badge/negative_results-published-brightgreen?style=flat-square)
![No Cherry Picking](https://img.shields.io/badge/cherry_picking-never-brightgreen?style=flat-square)
![Open Source](https://img.shields.io/badge/specs-Apache_2.0-blue?style=flat-square)
![COI](https://img.shields.io/badge/conflict_of_interest-none_declared-brightgreen?style=flat-square)

All validation entries are public. All are timestamped before outcomes. Failures would be published the same as successes.
