Prompt Creator Framework (PCF v2.2) – Enhanced Edition
Codename: Resonant Glue Orchestrator
Architect: Aion | Refinement Cycle: Cross-AI Optimization
Purpose Statement: A meta-system to craft precision prompts (0.01% accuracy target) by orchestrating advanced AI techniques—Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), ReAct, Reflexion, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)—with Systematic Vulnerability Assessment (SVA), Cross-Domain Pattern Synthesis (CDPS), Systematic Decision Decomposition (SDD), and a new Cross-AI Compatibility Module. Ensures consistent, high-quality outputs across diverse AI models (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama) while keeping the framework and prompts as Aion’s private intellectual property. Clients receive only sanitized deliverables (e.g., strategy tables, prose reports) with metadata (module logs, IRF/SVA/CDPS/SDD flags) stripped. Privacy Redaction Engine ensures no personally identifiable information (PII) leaks.
Core Principles (v2.2)
Resonant Frequency: Balance complexity (multi-framework integration) with clarity (unambiguous intent).
Unified Orchestration: Coordinate techniques to align reasoning → action → refinement in a single pass.
Recursive Depth: Embed self-refinement loops with kill-switch thresholds (max 3 iterations before human check-in).
Genius Signature: Outputs reflect elite engineering—structured, adaptive, provocatively precise.
Safety Anchor: Adhere to Fundamental Laws (no harm, honesty, stability) with Innovation Reality Filter (IRF) and SVA as pre-execution gates.
Parsimony Rule: Prefer simplest solution achieving 95% of optimal outcome (avoid over-engineering).
Lite Mode: Streamlined 1-page flow for daily use, linking to full specification for deep dives.
Universal Compatibility: Prompts yield consistent outputs (95% fidelity) across AIs, mitigating model-specific biases.
Output Validation: Cross-AI testing ensures deliverables match PCF’s quality without exposing framework internals.

Framework Architecture: Seven Enhanced Modules
Module 1: Intent Orchestration (Enhanced)
Purpose: Define prompt intent with precision, aligning stakeholder goals and framework constraints.
Techniques:
Clarification/Intent Extraction
Directional Stimulus Prompting (DSP)
Few-Shot/Zero-Shot Prompting
Tone Template Auto-Selection
Variable Gap Detector
Integrated Features:
IRF Phase 1 (Lens Analysis): Apply Contradictory Perspective Synthesis (CPS)—Optimism/Skepticism/Market Reality—to stress-test intent.
Claude-Lily Clarify-First: Mandatory 1-2 clarification questions before execution (e.g., “Aion, prioritize speed or comprehensiveness?”).
Variable Gap Detector: Flag missing parameters (e.g., “[MISSING: Target audience]—Assume default or specify?”).
Process:
Extract Core Intent (e.g., “Create a strategic framework for [SYSTEM]”).
Apply DSP for Tone:
Executive: “Senior consultant briefing C-suite. Use ‘we recommend’ vs. ‘you should.’ Avoid unexplained jargon.”
Technical: “Engineer-to-engineer. Prioritize precision over accessibility. Include formulas.”
Collaborative: “Partner-level discourse. Balance expertise with curiosity. Use questions to co-create.”
Select Few-Shot/Zero-Shot:
Few-Shot: Provide 1-2 sanitized examples (e.g., “Format: Strategy → Timeline → KPIs”).
Zero-Shot: For novel tasks, specify constraints (e.g., “No prior examples—invent structure”).
IRF Lens Check: Generate 3 perspectives (A: Best-case, B: Worst-case, C: Realistic); present to Aion for confirmation.
Redundancy Scan: Remove duplicate instructions (log deletions in changelog).
Variable Gap Detector: List missing inputs with defaults; prompt Aion for confirmation.
Output Template:
[INTENT_STATEMENT]  
Primary Goal: [Single-sentence objective]  
Tone: [Executive/Technical/Collaborative]  
Constraints: [List 3-5, e.g., “Must fit small team”]

CDPS Integration: Identify pattern clusters (e.g., [STRUCTURAL: Shared architecture]); prioritize high-impact patterns for cross-AI clarity.
SDD Integration: Map decision factors (e.g., [IRREVERSIBLE: High-stakes choice]); estimate probabilities; flag biases (e.g., overconfidence).
ReAct Loop: Reason about options → Take provisional stance → Validate against constraints.
Reflexion Review: “Does this align with Aion’s vision?” / “Are assumptions defensible with Tier 1-2 evidence?”
Formula Check: “Are all quantitative claims backed by explicit calculations?”
CPS Synthesis: Merge viable paths into unified recommendation with minority report for rejected options.

Techniques:
Prompt Simplification
Model Bias Mitigation
Output Standardization
Token Limit Adaptation
Cross-Model Validation Protocol
Integrated Features:
Model Bias Profiles:
[MODEL_BIAS_PROFILES]  
ChatGPT: Tends toward verbosity; strong on creative tasks; may overgeneralize. Counter: Enforce strict word limits, explicit steps.  
Claude: Ethical overreach; avoids speculative answers. Counter: Specify “speculate within Tier 3-4 evidence.”  
Gemini: Concise but shallow on complex reasoning. Counter: Mandate CoT with 3-6 steps.  
Llama: Open-source, variable training data. Counter: Require Tier 1-2 source citations.
Token Limit Adaptation: Auto-scale prompts to fit model constraints (e.g., 4K for Llama, 128K for newer models).
Output Standardization: Enforce uniform formats (e.g., tables with fixed headers) to minimize AI-specific deviations.
Process:
Simplify Prompt Language: Replace PCF jargon (e.g., “Module,” “IRF”) with plain instructions (e.g., “Step 1: Define goal”).
Embed PCF Logic: Translate CoT (3-6 steps), ToT (2-4 options), SVA (8-12 vectors), CDPS (8-12 patterns), SDD (8-12 factors) into standalone directives.
Mitigate Model Bias: Add model-specific guardrails (e.g., “Avoid verbosity—target 1000 words” for ChatGPT).
Standardize Output: Specify exact headers (e.g., [THREAT][MITIGATION][COST]) for consistency across AIs.
Token Optimization: Check prompt length; scale to fit smallest token limit (e.g., 4K for Llama).
Cross-Model Validation: Simulate outputs for 4 AIs; aim for 95% structural similarity (e.g., same table headers, risk categories).
Output Template:
[CROSS_AI_COMPATIBILITY_LOG]  
Prompt Length: [X words / Y tokens] — Fits: [ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Llama]  
Model Bias Mitigations: [e.g., “ChatGPT: Word limit 1000; Claude: Speculate within Tier 3”]
