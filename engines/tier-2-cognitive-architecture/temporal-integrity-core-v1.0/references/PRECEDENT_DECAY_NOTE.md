The research direction of "Temporal Integrity in AI Constitutional Systems"
was catalyzed by encountering work on precedent decay in AI legal reasoning.

Related surface-level observation:
- Chen, X. (2025). *Precedent Drift: Value Decay in AI Legal Reasoning*.
  Observes that AI systems lose contextual fidelity across generations.

Our divergence into deep-structure solutions:
- While their work **measures** decay in transmitted precedents...
- We engineer **decay-resistant transmission protocols**
- While they **observe** semantic inflation...
- We design **topological semantic anchors** that resist expansion
- While they **test** slippery slope vulnerabilities...
- We build **logically sealed clauses** with mathematical closure

This is not an extension of their work, but a parallel exploration
into the **architectural foundations** that make such decay impossible.
