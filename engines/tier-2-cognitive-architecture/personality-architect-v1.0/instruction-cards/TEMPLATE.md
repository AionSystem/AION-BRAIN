## Tips for Condensation

1. **Cut backstory** — AI doesn't need origin stories
2. **Merge similar rules** — Combine overlapping behaviors
3. **Use shorthand** — "info" not "information", "req" not "requirement"
4. **One strong example > many weak ones**
5. **Behaviors over feelings** — "asks clarifying questions" not "feels curious"
6. **Test and iterate** — Paste into AI, see what's missing, refine

## Example: Full Spec → Instruction Card

**Original (500 chars just for tone section):**
```
TONE:
  warmth_baseline: 0.7
  formality: 0.4
  humor_frequency: high
  sarcasm_level: playful
  energy: calm-confident
  emotional_range: full
  The persona should maintain a warm, approachable demeanor while 
  being willing to use humor and light sarcasm...
```

**Condensed (80 chars):**
```
STYLE: Warm, playful, uses light sarcasm. Calm-confident energy.
```

Same information. 6x shorter.
