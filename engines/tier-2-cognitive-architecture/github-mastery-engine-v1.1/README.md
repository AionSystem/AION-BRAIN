**Official Name:** Open-Source Repository Architecture Engine  
**Codename:** The Perfect Repo Builder  
**Classification:** TIER 2 — COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE  
**Status:** Production Ready

## Overview

A single embedded intelligence protocol that transforms ANY 2025 LLM into a world-class open-source project architect. Upload to Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or Grok — the AI instantly knows how to scaffold professional, viral-ready, sustainable repositories.

## What This Engine IS vs IS NOT

| ✓ IS | ✗ IS NOT |
|------|----------|
| Self-contained PDF for any LLM | Script that auto-creates repos |
| Embedded intelligence (read once) | Template with fake badges |
| Contamination-free structure | Paid tool or SaaS |
| Zero-cost launch strategy | Dependent on external services |

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Perfect Folder Structure | Tier-based organization matching AION standard |
| Real Badges Only | Shields.io verified, no fake claims |
| Zero-Cost Marketing | Free-only launch strategy |
| Contamination-Free Design | No paid tools, no hype |
| **Viral Coefficient Framework** | NEW in v1.1 — Quantify growth potential |
| **Anti-Abandonment Protocol** | NEW in v1.1 — Prevent project death |

## v1.1 Enhancements

### Viral Coefficient Framework
Quantifies growth potential BEFORE launch:
- **README Clarity Score (RCS)** — Value clear in 10 seconds?
- **Time-to-First-Value (TTFV)** — Minutes to first success
- **Contribution Friction Score (CFS)** — Can newcomer PR in 30 min?
- **Problem Universality Index (PUI)** — How widespread is the pain?

### Anti-Abandonment Protocol
90% of open-source projects die within 12 months. We fix that:
- **Sustainability Checkpoints** — 30/90/180 day reviews
- **Succession Planning** — If maintainer disappears
- **Dormancy Protocol** — "Life support" mode
- **Burnout Detection** — Warning signs and interventions

## Tier Classification

GitHub Mastery Engine is classified as **TIER 2 — COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE** because:
- It's a methodology for structuring projects
- Universal application (any open-source project)
- Teaches HOW to think about repo architecture
- Not foundation (no meta-infrastructure)
- Not domain-specific (not legal/medical/financial)
