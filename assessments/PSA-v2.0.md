## WHAT THIS ASSESSES

PSA v2.0 evaluates the cognitive signature of hyperphantasic polymaths — those who do not merely recall across domains, but who construct vivid, navigable mental architecture across them. Each of the 14 questions activates a distinct cognitive room. Together they assess whether you can move between rooms without losing the thread.

---

## FORMAT

- **Answer both Part A and Part B** for each question
- **Word limit:** 400–600 words per question (both parts combined)
- **Time:** No hard limit — estimated completion 90–150 minutes
- **Submission:** Return all 14 responses to your grader before the cipher page is revealed

## THE ASSESSMENT

*Fourteen questions. Fourteen cognitive rooms. One hidden word.*

---

### Q1 — HYPOTHESIS GENERATION FROM ANOMALY
**Task Type:** Abductive Reasoning & Falsifiability Design

> *Hypothesis formation is not guessing — it is structured ignorance made actionable. The structure is what separates science from storytelling.*

**Scenario:**
In a dataset of 40,000 users of a productivity application, users who set zero reminders outperform — by a statistically significant margin — users who set five or more reminders on every long-term goal-completion metric tracked.

**Part A:**
Generate three distinct, falsifiable hypotheses to explain this anomaly. Each must include the specific observation that would prove it wrong. Do not lead with the obvious hypothesis.

**Part B:**
Rank your three hypotheses by how hard each is to falsify, and explain what that ranking tells you about the nature of the anomaly itself. Which hypothesis, if true, would be most dangerous to act on prematurely — and why?

---

### Q2 — TEMPORAL PATTERN MAPPING
**Task Type:** Cross-Civilizational Pattern Recognition

> *Yesterday's failures are tomorrow's blueprints — if you have the discipline to read them without retrofitting the narrative to the outcome.*

**Scenario:**
Three institutions collapsed under structurally similar conditions but were separated by 1,400 years: the Western Roman Empire (476 CE), the Song Dynasty (1279 CE), and the Habsburg Empire (1918 CE). You are not being asked about history. You are being asked about pattern.

**Part A:**
Identify one structural mechanism shared across all three collapses that is not reducible to military defeat, economic failure, or plague. State it in precise, domain-agnostic language — as if briefing an engineer who has never studied history.

**Part B:**
Apply this mechanism to a currently active system — a technology platform, an institution, or an industry. What specific, observable signal would tell you the mechanism is already engaged in that system right now?

---

### Q3 — CROSS-DOMAIN SYNTHESIS
**Task Type:** Multi-Domain Causal Translation

> *Patterns don't belong to disciplines — they migrate. The question is whether you can follow them without losing what makes them true.*

**Scenario:**
A mycologist discovers that fungal networks distribute resources to trees under stress by rerouting flow away from high-performers toward struggling nodes. A venture capitalist reads the same study and makes a portfolio decision the next morning.

**Part A:**
What decision did the VC make? Trace the exact causal logic from the fungal mechanism to the investment move — step by step, without skipping the structural links.

**Part B:**
Where does this analogy break down? Name the specific structural difference between fungal networks and venture portfolios that, if ignored, would produce a confidently wrong decision.

---

### Q4 — EPISTEMIC FORENSICS
**Task Type:** Evidence Extraction Under Constraint

> *Every anomaly is a gap between the model and reality. The discipline is in knowing which one to revise.*

**Scenario:**
You enter a room. You are told only three things: (1) A meeting was held here four hours ago. (2) Everyone who attended left voluntarily. (3) The meeting achieved its stated objective. You cannot speak to anyone who attended.

**Part A:**
List five specific physical observations you would make in this room, and explain what each tells you about the meeting — its tone, its power dynamics, or its outcome. Be precise: vague observations score zero.

**Part B:**
Which of your five observations is the weakest evidence? What would transform it from weak to strong — and what does the act of strengthening it require you to assume?

---

### Q5 — REDUCTIONISM VS. SYSTEMS REASONING
**Task Type:** Meta-Level Methodological Analysis

> *Reductionism is not wrong — it is incomplete. The question is whether you know which problems require what level of description, and whether you can switch registers without losing precision.*

**Scenario:**
A neuroscientist argues: *"Depression is a serotonin deficit disorder — treat the molecule."* A systems theorist responds: *"Depression is a feedback collapse in social, biological, and environmental loops — treating one node changes nothing."* Both have peer-reviewed evidence.

**Part A:**
This is not a medical question. It is a question about levels of description. Construct the most intellectually honest version of each position — not the straw man, the steel man.

**Part B:**
Design an experiment or observation that would help adjudicate between the two positions without requiring either side to abandon their framework. What does the experiment assume, and what happens to its validity if that assumption is wrong?

---

### Q6 — PROBABILISTIC REASONING UNDER UNCERTAINTY
**Task Type:** Bayesian Calibration & Decision Architecture

> *Probability is not uncertainty made numerical. It is a commitment to act rationally under uncertainty — and commitments can be wrong in ways pure uncertainty cannot.*

**Scenario:**
You are advising a decision-maker who must choose between two paths. Path A has a 70% chance of a good outcome and a 30% chance of a catastrophic one. Path B has a 40% chance of a good outcome and a 60% chance of a mediocre one. The decision-maker says: *"I always choose the highest probability of success."*

**Part A:**
Identify everything the decision-maker's rule gets wrong. Be specific about which variables the rule ignores and under what conditions the rule would produce reliably bad decisions even if followed correctly.

**Part B:**
Design a better decision framework for this class of problem — one that handles asymmetric consequences, uncertainty about the probabilities themselves, and the difference between reversible and irreversible outcomes. State its assumptions explicitly.

---

### Q7 — HUMAN-TO-EXPERT TRANSLATION (FEYNMAN PROTOCOL)
**Task Type:** Compression Without Distortion

> *How you explain something reveals what you actually understand — and what you have merely memorized.*

**Scenario:**
You are a world-class expert in one domain (you choose which). A 14-year-old has asked you to explain the single most counterintuitive finding in your domain — something that violates common sense but is robustly true. You have four minutes of their attention.

**Part A:**
Write your explanation. You may use analogies, but every analogy must map onto the actual mechanism — not just the surface behavior. You must explicitly flag the moment where your analogy becomes imprecise.

**Part B:**
What did you sacrifice to make this explanation work? Which correct-but-complex nuance did you strip out — and how would you know if the 14-year-old later made a consequential decision based on the stripped-out version?

---

### Q8 — ADVERSARIAL PHILOSOPHICAL DEFENSE
**Task Type:** Dialectical Reasoning Under Structured Attack

> *Axioms are not truths. They are commitments. If you cannot defend your commitments under pressure, you do not hold them — they hold you.*

**Scenario:**
You have publicly argued: *"Meritocracy, properly designed, produces better outcomes than any alternative system of resource allocation."* An opponent responds: *"Every meritocracy to date has been a disguised aristocracy — it has always measured access, not ability, and called that measurement fair."*

**Part A:**
Steelman the opponent's counter-claim. Make it stronger than the opponent did. You are not trying to defeat it — you are trying to find the version of it that would actually challenge your position.

**Part B:**
Now respond to the strongest version you just constructed. What does your position require you to concede, what does it refuse to concede, and what empirical evidence — if it exists — would settle the dispute?

---

### Q9 — NARRATIVE DECONSTRUCTION
**Task Type:** Structural Story Analysis & Frame Detection

> *Narratives are not just stories — they are load-bearing structures. Every narrative carries assumptions that are invisible until the structure fails.*

**Scenario:**
The following narrative is widely accepted in business and technology culture: *"Disruption is inherently good. Incumbents deserve to fall. Innovators who break old systems create more value than they destroy."* You are not being asked whether this is true. You are being asked to expose its architecture.

**Part A:**
Identify the three deepest structural assumptions embedded in this narrative — the ones that must be true for the narrative to hold. For each, describe the evidence that would falsify it.

**Part B:**
Construct an alternative narrative that explains the same phenomenon (technological change and market transitions) but rests on different foundational assumptions. The alternative must be internally consistent and non-trivially different from the original — not its simple negation.

---

### Q10 — TEMPORAL STRATEGY — MULTI-HORIZON REASONING
**Task Type:** Long-Range Consequence Mapping

> *Time is the variable most reasoning ignores — not because it is unimportant, but because it is uncomfortable. Good decisions often look bad at the wrong timescale.*

**Scenario:**
You receive a sealed envelope from yourself dated 2040. It contains one sentence: *"You optimized for the wrong signal."* You do not know what decision this refers to — it could be professional, personal, or philosophical.

**Part A:**
Identify the three decisions you are currently making — or deferring — where optimizing for the wrong signal is most likely. For each, describe what the right signal would be and why you are not currently using it.

**Part B:**
Design a practice — a specific, recurring behavior — that would make you more likely to catch signal-optimization errors before they compound over a decade. What is the failure mode of this practice itself?

---

### Q11 — AESTHETIC REASONING AS EPISTEMIC SIGNAL
**Task Type:** Cross-Domain Aesthetic & Structural Analysis

> *Aesthetics is not decoration — it is compressed structural judgment. When something feels wrong before you can explain why, that feeling is a data point worth interrogating.*

**Scenario:**
A master architect, a seasoned jazz musician, and a veteran military strategist are each asked to evaluate the same business plan. None of them reads it analytically. Each reacts aesthetically: the architect says *"it has no load-bearing center,"* the musician says *"it has no resolution,"* the strategist says *"it has no fallback position."*

**Part A:**
All three are correct. Explain the structural flaw in the business plan that all three have independently detected using the vocabulary of their own domain. Your explanation must identify the single underlying failure that generates all three aesthetic reactions.

**Part B:**
Design a diagnostic protocol for your own domain — a set of aesthetic signals (feelings of wrongness before analytical explanation) that reliably detect structural failure. What is the risk of trusting these signals, and when should you override them?

---

### Q12 — SYSTEMS MODELING WITHOUT ARITHMETIC
**Task Type:** Formal Structural Reasoning

> *Systems fail not at their strongest point but at the interface between their strongest points — where assumptions about how they connect turn out to be wrong.*

> **⚠ CONSTRAINT:** You are not allowed to use a single number, percentage, or statistic in your response to this question. Use of any numerical value constitutes an automatic zero for the Structural Validity dimension.

**Scenario:**
You must describe a system you understand deeply using only structural relationships, variables, causal direction, and feedback dynamics.

**Part A:**
Choose any system you know well. Describe its core model: what its variables are, how they relate, which direction causality flows, and where feedback loops exist. Treat this as a verbal blueprint an engineer could use to begin building a simulation.

**Part B:**
Identify the variable in your model most dangerous if mismeasured — not just the one that produces bad output, but the one that produces *confidently wrong* output. Describe the specific sequence of events by which that mismeasurement would cascade before anyone detected it.

---

### Q13 — INTROSPECTIVE SYSTEMS DESIGN
**Task Type:** Meta-Cognitive Architecture & Error Detection

> *Introspection without rigor produces narrative, not diagnosis. The self is a system. Map it like one — including the parts that don't want to be mapped.*

**Scenario:**
Design a personal epistemics system — a structured set of practices that would detect when your reasoning is failing in ways you cannot currently see. This is not a productivity system. It is an early-warning architecture for structural errors in your thinking.

**Part A:**
Describe the system: its inputs, outputs, feedback loops, and failure modes. What triggers it to activate? Describe a specific instance from the past year where you would have deployed it — and what it would have caught.

**Part B:**
Every system has a blind spot built into its architecture. What is the structural blind spot of the system you just designed — the failure mode it cannot see because of what it is? How would someone outside your system detect that it had failed you without your awareness?

---

### Q14 — CONVERGENCE SYNTHESIS
**Task Type:** Cross-Assessment Integration — The Final Room

> *All maps are wrong. Some maps are useful. The rarest skill is knowing which errors in which maps matter — and building bridges between maps that were drawn by people who never spoke to each other.*

> **⚠ REQUIREMENT:** This question requires you to draw explicitly on your responses to **at least four previous questions**. You may not introduce new material — only synthesize what you have already argued across Q1 through Q13.

**Part A:**
Identify the single deepest structural principle that appears — in different forms — across your answers to the previous 13 questions. State it as a precise, domain-agnostic claim. Demonstrate how it surfaces in at least four prior responses, using specific language from those answers.

**Part B:**
Now challenge it. Which answer you gave earlier is most in tension with this principle? Is the tension resolvable — or does it reveal a genuine limit in the principle? If it reveals a limit, state that limit precisely. Explain why you would keep the principle despite knowing the limit exists.
