## Professional Liability Framework

### The Standard of Care

Professional malpractice claims require proving breach of the applicable standard of care. Using AI tools like AION-BRAIN frameworks does NOT change the standard of care.

```
PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY ELEMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

To establish professional malpractice, plaintiff must prove:

1. DUTY
   └─ Professional owed duty of care to plaintiff
   └─ UNCHANGED by AI tool use

2. BREACH
   └─ Professional failed to meet standard of care
   └─ Standard = What reasonably competent professional would do
   └─ AI tools are ADJUNCT to professional judgment, not substitute

3. CAUSATION
   └─ Breach caused plaintiff's harm
   └─ Both actual cause and proximate cause required

4. DAMAGES
   └─ Plaintiff suffered compensable harm
   └─ Economic and/or non-economic damages

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PROPER DOCUMENTATION DEFEATS BREACH ALLEGATIONS
```

### AI Tools and Standard of Care

| Aspect | Analysis |
|--------|----------|
| **AI as Tool** | AI is a tool like reference books, calculators, or databases |
| **Standard Unchanged** | Professional must still exercise independent judgment |
| **Verification Required** | Professional must verify AI outputs |
| **Documentation Key** | Document professional reasoning, not just AI output |

## Audit Trail Best Practices

### General Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Contemporaneous** | Document at time of decision, not after |
| **Complete** | Include all relevant factors considered |
| **Independent** | Document YOUR reasoning, not just AI output |

└─ Risk-benefit analysis

NEVER DOCUMENT (Liability Risk):
├─ Sole reliance on AI output
├─ Failure to verify
├─ Unthinking acceptance of AI suggestions
├─ Lack of independent judgment
├─ Failure to consider alternatives
└─ Overconfidence in AI accuracy
```

### Retention Requirements

| Domain | Retention Period | Authority |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Medical | 6-10 years (varies by state) | State medical records laws |
| Legal | 5-7 years after matter closes | State bar rules |
| Financial | 5-6 years | SEC, FINRA rules |
