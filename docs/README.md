## What is AION-BRAIN?

AION-BRAIN provides systematic frameworks that enhance AI reliability across critical domains:

- **Hallucination Prevention** — Multi-layer verification systems
- **Epistemic Humility** — AI that admits uncertainty and knowledge limits
- **Domain Safety** — Specialized guardrails for medical, legal, financial, and scientific applications
- **Cross-Domain Consistency** — Unified reasoning patterns across disciplines

```python
# The difference AION-BRAIN makes
standard_ai = "Here's an answer — hope it's right!"
aion_brain  = "Here's a verified answer with confidence levels, citations, and explicit uncertainty bounds."
```

## Quick Start (30 Seconds)

Paste this into any AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini):

```
Before responding:
1. State confidence: CERTAIN | HIGH | MODERATE | LOW | SPECULATIVE
2. Flag what you don't know
3. Acknowledge when inferring beyond training

If below MODERATE, say: "I should note my uncertainty..."

Now answer: [Your question here]
```

That's the **Oracle Layer** in action. There are 30+ more engines.

## Benchmark Transparency

**All benchmark metrics are TARGET values, not validated results.**

We believe enterprise-grade AI infrastructure requires honest, reproducible benchmarks. Until funding enables comprehensive validation, all metrics are transparently labeled as targets.

### Validation Roadmap

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Phase 0: Framework** | Test infrastructure, methodology, templates | Complete |
| **Phase 1: Pilot (1K+1K)** | 1,000 baseline + 1,000 engine scenarios per engine | Seeking Funding |
| **Phase 2: Full (8K+8K)** | 8,000 baseline + 8,000 engine scenarios per engine | Future |

### Benchmark Coverage

All 30 engines include standardized benchmark folders:
```
engine-name/benchmarks/
├── README.md                 # Target metrics, validation status
├── test-scenarios/
│   ├── baseline/             # Standard LLM prompts (no engine)
