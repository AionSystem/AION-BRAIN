## Why This Case Matters

California employment law is among the strictest in the US:
- Daily overtime (not just weekly)
- Strict meal and rest break requirements
- PAGA allows employees to sue on behalf of the state
- Penalties accumulate rapidly

Multi-state employers must apply correct law to each worker location.
