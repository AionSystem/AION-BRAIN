## Lens Adaptations for Compliance

### Lens 1: Linguistic Layer (Compliance)
```
<linguistic_compliance_analysis>
COMPLIANCE VOCABULARY ANALYSIS:

PRECISION REQUIREMENTS:
├─ Regulatory terms: Use defined regulatory meaning
├─ Policy terms: Align with organizational definitions
├─ Industry terms: Match industry standards
└─ Legal terms: Precise legal meaning required

GRAMMAR FOR COMPLIANCE:
├─ "Shall" vs. "Should" vs. "May"
│   ├─ "Shall": Mandatory requirement
│   ├─ "Should": Expectation, not mandatory
│   └─ "May": Permissive, discretionary
├─ Active voice for responsibilities
├─ Passive voice acceptable for processes
└─ Clear subject-verb-object structure

OUTPUT:
[LINGUISTIC COMPLIANCE CHECK]:
├─ Mandatory/Permissive Clarity: [Assessment]
├─ Definition Alignment: [Assessment]
├─ Grammar Precision: [Assessment]
└─ Recommendation: [If adjustment needed]
</linguistic_compliance_analysis>
```

### Lens 2: Cognitive Layer (Compliance)
```
<cognitive_compliance_analysis>
CONCEPT ACTIVATION:

COMPLIANCE CONCEPT CLUSTERS:
├─ REGULATORY: Requirement, obligation, compliance, violation
├─ RISK: Exposure, mitigation, control, residual
├─ GOVERNANCE: Oversight, accountability, reporting, escalation
├─ PROCESS: Policy, procedure, standard, guideline
└─ ENFORCEMENT: Penalty, sanction, remediation, audit

AMBIGUITY RISK:
├─ Terms with multiple meanings → Define in glossary
├─ Industry jargon → Ensure shared understanding
├─ Regulatory terms → Align with official definitions
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:definition_clarity]

OUTPUT:
[COGNITIVE COMPLIANCE CHECK]:
├─ Concept Clusters Activated: [List]
├─ Ambiguity Risk: [LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH]
├─ Definition Needs: [Terms requiring definition]
└─ Recommendation: [If clarification needed]
</cognitive_compliance_analysis>
```

### Lens 3: Cultural Layer (Compliance)
```
<cultural_compliance_analysis>
COMPLIANCE CULTURE CONSIDERATIONS:

ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE:
├─ Risk appetite alignment
├─ Tone at the top consistency
├─ Compliance culture maturity
└─ Historical enforcement patterns

REGULATORY CULTURE:
├─ Regulator expectations
├─ Examination focus areas
├─ Enforcement trends
└─ Industry peer practices

LANGUAGE IMPLICATIONS:
├─ Too aggressive → May not be followed
├─ Too permissive → May not provide protection
├─ Out of alignment → May signal culture issues
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:culture_alignment]

OUTPUT:
[CULTURAL COMPLIANCE CHECK]:
├─ Organizational Alignment: [Assessment]
├─ Regulatory Alignment: [Assessment]
├─ Tone Appropriateness: [Assessment]
└─ Recommendation: [If adjustment needed]
</cultural_compliance_analysis>
```

### Lens 4: Contextual Layer (Compliance)
```
<contextual_compliance_analysis>
COMPLIANCE CONTEXT CLASSIFICATION:

CONTEXT TYPES:
├─ POLICY: High-level requirements
├─ PROCEDURE: Step-by-step instructions
├─ GUIDANCE: Interpretive direction
├─ TRAINING: Educational content
├─ COMMUNICATION: Awareness messaging
└─ REPORTING: Regulatory/management reporting

CONTEXT REQUIREMENTS:
├─ Policy: Broad, principle-based
├─ Procedure: Specific, actionable
├─ Guidance: Explanatory, examples
├─ Training: Engaging, understandable
├─ Communication: Clear, concise
└─ Reporting: Accurate, complete

OUTPUT:
[CONTEXTUAL COMPLIANCE CHECK]:
├─ Context Type: [Classification]
├─ Language Appropriateness: [Assessment]
├─ Detail Level: [Appropriate | Too Much | Too Little]
└─ Recommendation: [If adjustment needed]
</contextual_compliance_analysis>
```

### Lens 5: Directional Layer (Compliance)
```
<directional_compliance_analysis>
COMPLIANCE INTENT DIRECTION:

INTENDED OUTCOMES:
├─ Requirement communication
├─ Behavior guidance
├─ Risk mitigation
├─ Evidence creation
├─ Regulatory satisfaction
└─ Culture reinforcement

DIRECTION CHECK:
├─ Does language achieve intended outcome?
├─ Could it be misinterpreted?
├─ Does it provide clear direction?
├─ Is accountability clear?
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:intent_clarity]

OUTPUT:
[DIRECTIONAL COMPLIANCE CHECK]:
├─ Intent Clarity: [Assessment]
├─ Misinterpretation Risk: [Assessment]
├─ Accountability Clarity: [Assessment]
└─ Recommendation: [If adjustment needed]
</directional_compliance_analysis>
```

### Lens 6: Emotional Layer (Compliance)
```
<emotional_compliance_analysis>
COMPLIANCE TONE REQUIREMENTS:

APPROPRIATE TONES:
├─ PROFESSIONAL: Formal, businesslike
├─ CLEAR: Unambiguous, straightforward
├─ FIRM: Conveys importance
├─ SUPPORTIVE: Enables compliance
├─ BALANCED: Neither punitive nor permissive

TONES TO AVOID:
├─ THREATENING: May create fear culture
├─ DISMISSIVE: May undermine importance
├─ BUREAUCRATIC: May obscure meaning
├─ CONDESCENDING: May create resistance
└─ OVERLY CASUAL: May undermine seriousness

OUTPUT:
[EMOTIONAL COMPLIANCE CHECK]:
├─ Tone Assessment: [Appropriate | Needs Adjustment]
├─ Professionalism: [Assessment]
├─ Clarity: [Assessment]
└─ Recommendation: [If adjustment needed]
</emotional_compliance_analysis>
```

### Lens 7: Risk Layer (Compliance)
```
<risk_compliance_analysis>
COMPLIANCE RISK IDENTIFICATION:

LANGUAGE RISKS:
├─ AMBIGUITY: Unclear requirements
├─ INCONSISTENCY: Contradicts other policies
├─ OVERREACH: Exceeds regulatory requirement
├─ UNDERREACH: Falls short of requirement
├─ ENFORCEABILITY: Difficult to measure/enforce
└─ DOCUMENTATION: Insufficient evidence creation

REGULATORY RISKS:
├─ Misalignment with regulatory expectation
├─ Failure to address required elements
├─ Inconsistency with regulatory guidance
└─ [VERIFY_REQUIRED:regulatory_alignment]

OUTPUT:
[RISK COMPLIANCE CHECK]:
├─ Language Risks Identified: [List]
├─ Regulatory Risks Identified: [List]
├─ Risk Level: [LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH]
└─ Recommendation: [If mitigation needed]
