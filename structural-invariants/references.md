### Structural Safety via Geometric Constraints (Related Work)

Atchley, D. E. (2025–2026). *Structural AI Safety via Geometric Invariants: Formal Foundations, Empirical Validation, and Deployment Protocols*. AUF Safety Research Initiative.

This work explores preventing agency emergence through structural and geometric constraints on neural representations, including spectral gaps, topological invariants, and metric-based monitoring. It demonstrates that non-agentic computation can be enforced at the representational level with empirical validation across multiple architectures.

Relevance:
- Demonstrates feasibility of **structural (non-behavioral) safety constraints**
- Provides empirical evidence that safety constraints can preserve performance
- Operates primarily at the **model-internal geometry level**

Distinction:
- This repository does **not** adopt AUF axioms, theorems, or measurement protocols
- Our system invariants operate at the **constitutional, operational, and failure-mode layers**, not solely representational geometry
- AUF is treated as adjacent prior art, not a dependency or foundation
