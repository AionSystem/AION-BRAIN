### 2. GRANT OF LICENSE — NON-COMMERCIAL

Subject to the terms of this license, Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to:

- Use, copy, and modify the Software for Non-Commercial Use only
- Distribute copies of the Software for Non-Commercial Use provided this complete license is included unmodified in all distributions
- Create Derivative Works for Non-Commercial Use provided attribution requirements in Section 6 are met and this complete license is included in all Derivative Works

This grant is conditional on continued compliance with all terms of this license. Any breach terminates this grant subject to the cure provisions of Section 9.

---

### 3. COMMERCIAL USE — SEPARATE LICENSE REQUIRED

**COMMERCIAL USE OF THE SOFTWARE REQUIRES A SEPARATE WRITTEN COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT SIGNED BY SHELDON K. SALMON.**

No commercial license is granted by this document. Using the Software for Commercial Use without a signed commercial license agreement is copyright infringement and a breach of this license, and may subject You to civil and criminal liability under applicable copyright law.

The court in *Artifex Software, Inc. v. Hancom, Inc.* (N.D. Cal. 2017) confirmed that dual-licensed software is enforceable and that unlicensed commercial use of open source code constitutes both breach of contract and copyright infringement. A jury may use the value of a commercial license as the basis for damages.

### 12. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

This license, together with LICENSE.md governing specifications, constitutes the entire agreement between You and Licensor with respect to the AION-BRAIN repository materials.

### 13. RELATIONSHIP OF THE TWO LICENSES

LICENSE.md (CC BY 4.0) and this license (AION-BRAIN Commercial Source License v1.1) govern distinct categories of material in this repository. They operate independently. Compliance with one does not constitute compliance with the other.

Reading the Specifications and building a new implementation from scratch based on those specifications is a use of the Specifications governed by LICENSE.md.

Copying, modifying, or deploying the existing implementation code from this repository is a use of the Software governed by this license.

**The blueprint is open. The built engine is not.**
