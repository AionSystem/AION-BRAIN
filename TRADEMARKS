Salmon's services are covered by trademark law.

This means:
- Building a competing product is not prohibited by trademark law
- Calling your competing product "VELA," "AION," or "FSVE" is prohibited
- Using these marks in ways that imply association with or endorsement by Sheldon K. Salmon is prohibited
