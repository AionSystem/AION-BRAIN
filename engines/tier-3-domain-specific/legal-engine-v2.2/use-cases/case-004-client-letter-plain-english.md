## Scenario

An attorney needs to explain a summary judgment motion to a non-lawyer client in accessible language while maintaining legal accuracy.

### Query to Legal Engine v2.2

```
<ENGINE: LEGAL_v2.1>
<DOCUMENT_TYPE: CLIENT_LETTER>

Explain to my client what just happened: the defendant filed a 
motion for summary judgment arguing there are no genuine issues 
of material fact. The hearing is in 30 days. What does this mean 
and what are our options?

Dear [CLIENT_A]:

I'm writing to update you on an important development in your case.

WHAT HAPPENED

The defendant has asked the judge to decide the case without a trial.
This type of request is called a "motion for summary judgment."

In plain terms, the defendant is arguing:
• There are no disagreements about the key facts
• Based on those facts, the law says they should win
• Therefore, there's no need for a jury trial

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU

If the judge agrees with the defendant, your case would be dismissed 
without ever going to trial. However, this is not automatic—we have 
the opportunity to respond and argue against dismissal.

Judges grant these motions only when it's clear that one side must 
win based on undisputed facts. If there are any genuine disagreements 
about what happened, the judge should deny the motion and let a jury 
decide.

OUR OPTIONS

We have 30 days to respond. Here's what we can do:

1. FILE AN OPPOSITION
   We can submit a written response explaining why there ARE 
   genuine factual disputes that require a trial. This is the 
   most common approach.

2. REQUEST MORE TIME
   If we need additional time to gather evidence or prepare our 
   response, we can ask the court for an extension.

3. FILE OUR OWN MOTION
   We could file our own summary judgment motion arguing that 
   YOU should win without trial.

NEXT STEPS

I recommend we file a strong opposition showing the court that:
• There are disputed facts the jury needs to resolve
• The defendant's version of events is not the complete picture
• You deserve your day in court

Please call me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss 
the facts in more detail. I'll need your input on several key 
points.

The deadline for our response is [DATE]. Please contact me within 
the next week so we have time to prepare a thorough response.

Sincerely,
[Attorney Name]

## Why This Case Matters

Effective client communication is required by Model Rule 1.4:
- Clients must understand their case to make decisions
- Legal jargon can confuse and alienate clients
- Plain English builds trust and enables informed consent
