## Architectural Pattern Recognition

The NRA-IDE framework demonstrates a radical approach to AI safety:
- **Structure-pure validation** (no semantic interpretation)
- **Causal diodes** (Π⁻¹ forbidden, one-way information flow)
- **Layer isolation** (prevention of collusion)
- **Fail-closed design** (uncertainty → silence, not guessing)

## Our Divergence into Constitutional Safety

While NRA-IDE removes semantics to prevent gaming...
We **embed semantics into mathematical structures** so deeply that:
- Gaming the structure requires breaking mathematical invariants
- Semantic manipulation causes topological rupture
- Ethical meaning becomes a **property of the structure itself**

This is not an adaptation but a **foundational reinvention**:
From "safety without meaning" to "meaning as structural invariant."
