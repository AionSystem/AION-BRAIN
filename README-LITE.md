## What Is This?

Cognitive infrastructure that makes AI:
- Admit uncertainty
- Reason ethically
- Operate safely in high-stakes domains
- Prevent cognitive contamination

**1,350+ files. 550+ directories. 30 engines. 7 working Python implementations. 394 tests passing.**

## Try It Now (30 Seconds)

Paste this into any AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini):

```
Before responding:
1. State confidence: CERTAIN | HIGH | MODERATE | LOW | SPECULATIVE
2. Flag what you don't know
3. Acknowledge when inferring beyond training

If below MODERATE, say: "I should note my uncertainty..."

Now answer: [Your question here]
```

That's the Oracle Layer in action. There are 30+ more engines.

## Benchmark Transparency

**All metrics are TARGET values, not validated results.**

Every engine includes:
- `benchmarks/` folder with test scenarios
- Reproducible methodology
- Transparent status labels

See [BENCHMARKS-OVERVIEW.md](engines/BENCHMARKS-OVERVIEW.md) for validation roadmap.
