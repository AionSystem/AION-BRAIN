## Training Module: Query Formulation

### Best Practices

```
EFFECTIVE REGULATORY QUERIES
============================

GOOD QUERY STRUCTURE:
<REGULATORY_ENGINE_v2.0>
<MODE: COMPLIANCE_ANALYSIS>
<MODULE: [Appropriate module]>

CONTEXT:
- Entity: [Specific entity information]
- Industry: [Sector]
- Jurisdictions: [Where operating]
- Activity: [What being analyzed]

QUESTION:
[Specific, focused regulatory question]

OUTPUT NEEDED:
[What format/depth required]
</REGULATORY_ENGINE_v2.0>

EXAMPLE - GOOD:
"What are the state licensing requirements for a
money transmitter operating in California, Texas,
and New York, including application timelines and
bond requirements?"

EXAMPLE - BAD:
"What licenses do I need?"
(Too vague—no entity, jurisdiction, or activity)

QUERY QUALITY CHECKLIST:
□ Specific entity/activity described
□ Jurisdictions identified
□ Regulatory topic focused
□ Desired output format clear
□ Time sensitivity noted if applicable
```

### Output Interpretation

```
INTERPRETING ENGINE OUTPUT
==========================

CONFIDENCE INDICATORS:
- VERIFY_REQUIRED: Must check with authoritative source
- CURRENCY_CHECK: Regulation may have changed
- HIGH CONFIDENCE: Well-established, verify anyway
- MEDIUM CONFIDENCE: More verification needed
- LOW CONFIDENCE: Treat as starting point only

CITATION VERIFICATION:
1. Check all regulatory citations against eCFR.gov
2. Verify state citations against state codes
3. Confirm agency guidance is current
4. Note any effective date concerns
5. Document verification for audit trail

ACTION ITEMS:
├─ Treat output as research assistance
├─ Never rely solely on engine output
├─ Verify with regulatory counsel
├─ Document decision rationale
└─ Update as regulations change
```
