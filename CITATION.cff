abstract: >-
  AION-BRAIN is a research-grade cognitive architecture providing systematic
  frameworks for human-AI collaboration. The project offers 30+ designed
  cognitive engines with 7 reference implementations, focusing on epistemic
  humility, contamination prevention, and systematic reasoning across medical,
  legal, financial, and strategic domains. Unlike prompt collections,
  AION-BRAIN provides falsifiable hypotheses, standardized test scenarios,
  and reproducible validation protocols. The architecture is designed to work
  with any large language model (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) while
  maintaining human cognitive sovereignty through systematic thinking protocols.

# Usage Notes
notes: >-
  This is research software, not production code. All performance claims are 
  hypotheses requiring empirical validation. Medical, legal, and financial 
  applications require professional oversight. The architecture is designed 
  for systematic evaluation of cognitive augmentation approaches.

# Acknowledgments
acknowledgements: >-
  The AION-BRAIN project acknowledges the cognitive science, AI safety, and 
  systems thinking communities whose work informs this architecture. Special 
  thanks to early collaborators and contributors who help refine these 
  systematic thinking tools.
